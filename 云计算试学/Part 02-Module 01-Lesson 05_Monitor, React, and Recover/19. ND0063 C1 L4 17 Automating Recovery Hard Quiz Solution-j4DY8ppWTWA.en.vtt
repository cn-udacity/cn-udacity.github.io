00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.045
What are risks to trying to automate recovery?

00:00:03.045 --> 00:00:05.550
The answer is, there is some risk to

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.315
false positive alerts causing action when none is required.

00:00:09.315 --> 00:00:12.120
This can be mitigated by limiting automation

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.195
to only actions without large negative side effects.

00:00:15.195 --> 00:00:17.610
For example, adding more disk space,

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.370
there is some cost but no real harm.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.845
Runaway automation is another risk.

00:00:22.845 --> 00:00:25.665
Revisiting our disk space example,

00:00:25.665 --> 00:00:30.340
if the automation were to run a way and keep adding disc space in a loop,

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.105
this could become problematic,

00:00:32.105 --> 00:00:33.980
or at least very expensive.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.970
Putting guardrails in place is a good practice to limit this.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.190
You could write automation that would have an additional check,

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.175
that is not trying to increase your disk space to greater than five terabytes.

00:00:46.175 --> 00:00:49.025
Too much free time is almost never a problem.

00:00:49.025 --> 00:00:54.140
Rather, automating oneself out of some current responsibilities allows one to take

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.900
on other more strategic responsibilities and add even more value to the organization.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.665
Spending less time taking care of routine maintenance

00:01:03.665 --> 00:01:08.250
allows for more time to be spent on preventing larger issues.
