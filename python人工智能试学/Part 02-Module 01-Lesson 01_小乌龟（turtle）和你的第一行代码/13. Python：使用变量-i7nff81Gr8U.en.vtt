00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
Earlier on, we talked about the idea of an assignment statement,
刚才我们讲了一个赋值语句的想法 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.570
like for example any equals turtle.Turtle.
比如像龟龟

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.230
It takes whatever's on the right hand side of
无论在哪一边

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.535
the equals sign and it assigns it to the variable that's named on the left.
等号 并将其分配给左边指定的变量 

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:18.210
In this case, the code on the right creates
在这种情况下 正确创建的代码

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.164
a new turtle object and this turtle object gets assigned to the variable named amy.
一个新的海龟对象 这个海龟对象被分配给叫做 amy的变量 

00:00:24.164 --> 00:00:27.664
But we don't have to limit ourselves to Turtle objects,
但我们不必局限于 Turtle 对象

00:00:27.664 --> 00:00:30.559
we can assign other things to variables too.
我们也可以把其他东西分配给变量

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:33.359
For example, this statement assigns
例如 此语句指定

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:36.894
the string yellow to a variable called a pretty color.
字符串黄色到一个被称为相当颜色的变量 

00:00:36.895 --> 00:00:39.870
Let's see how we might use something like this.
让我们看看我们如何使用类似的东西 

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:44.634
Here's our familiar code that has the turtle "Draw a yellow square."
这是我们熟悉的代码 有乌龟 "画黄色正方形 "  

00:00:44.634 --> 00:00:49.809
Only we'll change it a little by adding this assignment statement right here.
只有我们在这里添加这个赋值语句来改变它

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.140
Now that we've assigned the string yellow to this pretty color variable,
现在我们已经把黄色的颜色分配给了这个美丽的颜色

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.365
we can use that variable any place in the code where we need that string.
我们可以用这个变量在代码中的任何地方

00:00:58.365 --> 00:01:01.829
So, instead of putting yellow here on this line,
所以不要把黄色放在这条线上

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.489
we can put pretty color instead.
我们可以用漂亮的颜色

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.179
That will have exactly the same effect.
这将产生完全相同的效果 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.010
The turtle will draw a yellow square.
乌龟会画一个黄色的正方形 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.740
One of the nice things but doing it this way is
其中一件好事就是这样做

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:15.229
that we can use that variable in multiple places.
我们可以在多个地方使用这个变量

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.150
Like if we also had some other turtles drawing some other shapes,
就像我们也有其他海龟在绘制其他形状

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.350
we could use the same pretty color
我们可以用同样的颜色

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:25.539
variable to set the color that they're drawing as well.
变量来设置它们所绘制的颜色 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.340
Then if we decided that we didn't think yellow was such a pretty color after all,
然后如果我们决定我们认为黄色毕竟不是很漂亮的颜色 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.075
we could change the string that's assigned to the variable.
我们可以更改分配给变量的字符串 

00:01:34.075 --> 00:01:37.880
Like, let's say that now instead of assigning the string yellow,
就说现在不说给串黄了 

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:40.655
we'll assign the string, light blue.
我们会把琴弦亮蓝色

00:01:40.655 --> 00:01:45.885
So now this name pretty color will refer to the string light blue instead.
所以现在这个名字漂亮的颜色会指的是弦的浅蓝色 

00:01:45.885 --> 00:01:51.210
The nice thing is that we only have to modify this variable in this one spot,
好的是我们只需要在这个地方修改这个变量

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:54.969
but this string will be getting used in all of these different places.
但这条线将会被用于所有这些不同的地方

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:59.189
So all of these turtles are now drawing in light blue.
所以这些海龟都是用浅蓝色绘制的
