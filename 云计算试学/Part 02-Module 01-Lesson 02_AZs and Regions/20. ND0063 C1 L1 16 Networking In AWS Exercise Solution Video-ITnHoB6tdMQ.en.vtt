00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.175
In this exercise, you'll be creating a NAT gateway and associating it with a subnet.

00:00:05.175 --> 00:00:06.795
In order to do that,

00:00:06.795 --> 00:00:09.600
let's take a look at how you would create a NAT gateway.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.260
NAT gateways ask you for a couple of options,.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.030
The first is the subnet.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.330
So you'll want to pick the subnet within

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.900
the new VPC that you just created, your public subnet.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.485
The NAT gateway itself sits in a public subnet,

00:00:25.485 --> 00:00:29.280
and then it has access to the Internet from there.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.235
To pick your Elastic IP address,

00:00:32.235 --> 00:00:34.665
you can allocate a new IP address,

00:00:34.665 --> 00:00:37.665
or if you already have one in your account you can use that,

00:00:37.665 --> 00:00:42.300
but this is the public address that the NAT gateway itself will use.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.705
Once you have your NAT gateway,

00:00:44.705 --> 00:00:47.165
you'll look at your routing tables,

00:00:47.165 --> 00:00:50.015
and you'll look for the routing table that does not have

00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:52.900
an explicit subnet association already.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.665
The one that does have the subnet association is the one that's already in use.

00:00:57.665 --> 00:01:02.040
We take a look at this routing table and then the routes within it.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:10.650
We'll see that the only route is local route to the CDIR range of the VPC.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.035
From here, we'll add another route,

00:01:13.035 --> 00:01:15.635
and this second route will be your default route,

00:01:15.635 --> 00:01:19.680
and it will point at the newly created NAT gateway
