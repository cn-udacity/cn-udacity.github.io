00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
You're doing great. We've covered foundational AWS redundancy concepts,

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.235
redundancy on AWS application services,

00:00:08.235 --> 00:00:12.570
and looked at how this all ties in to the objectives of your business.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.980
Now we're going to look at how you find and react to failures within your platform.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.770
In this lesson, we'll go over some of the techniques and technologies around both

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.690
keeping track of your platform state as well as recovering from failures that occur.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.960
Monitoring is crucial to understanding what is happening in your systems.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.485
The counterpart to monitoring is alerting.

00:00:36.485 --> 00:00:40.895
Alerting allows your platform to tell you when something is wrong.

00:00:40.895 --> 00:00:43.190
Without monitoring and alerting,

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.670
you are clueless about what is happening within your application.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.600
When failures occur, and they will how you recover from

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.570
them comes down to identifying the cause of the issue and rectifying it.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.095
To correct problems within your systems,

00:00:58.095 --> 00:01:03.240
we'll wrap up by looking at techniques for automating the recovery from failure.
