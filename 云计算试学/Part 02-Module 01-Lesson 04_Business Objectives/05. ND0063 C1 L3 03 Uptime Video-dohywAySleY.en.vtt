00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
Uptime is usually measured as a percentage of time that assistance is available.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:12.270
99.9 percent is a standard uptime provided by many Service Level Agreements or SLAs.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:18.780
This means that your service should be up and running normally 99.9 percent of the time,

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.435
typically measured over the course of a month.

00:00:21.435 --> 00:00:24.705
You will agree on this metric with your customers.

00:00:24.705 --> 00:00:27.810
You are attesting to the fact that you can keep

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.140
your platform available that percentage of the time,

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.130
and your customer finds that amount of time to be acceptable.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.785
Depending on your product and industry,

00:00:37.785 --> 00:00:41.565
your SLA may define a higher or lower uptime.

00:00:41.565 --> 00:00:46.685
You will also likely face penalties if you do not achieve your uptime commitment.

00:00:46.685 --> 00:00:48.890
This usually comes in the form of

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.640
monetary or service credits that you would owe your customers.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.695
Meeting your SLA requires diligence.

00:00:55.695 --> 00:00:58.850
You will need to track your platforms uptime so that you can

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.620
demonstrate to your customers that you are measuring it and meeting commitments.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.980
In order to maintain a high level of uptime,

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.445
you need to have redundancy throughout your service.

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:14.915
Uptime is usually referred to as a number of nines.

00:01:14.915 --> 00:01:24.245
For example, an SLA of 99.9 percent is referred to as having three nines of availability.

00:01:24.245 --> 00:01:28.960
You will also hear terms such as three and a half nines.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.715
This would mean 99.95 percent uptime.

00:01:33.715 --> 00:01:36.320
To reach a moderate level of uptime,

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.810
you cannot have a single point of failure.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.790
A single point of failure is any one component that were it to fail,

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.515
would take down a system until it were repaired or replaced.

00:01:47.515 --> 00:01:49.935
Any single point of failure will,

00:01:49.935 --> 00:01:51.455
at some point, fail.

00:01:51.455 --> 00:01:53.660
You could call this Murphy's law,

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.380
but really it's just probability, everything fails eventually.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.610
When this happens, the time required to recover will likely cause you to miss your SLA.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.635
Be thoughtful of all the things that need to be redundant;

00:02:08.635 --> 00:02:12.614
databases, networking, servers, caches,

00:02:12.614 --> 00:02:17.300
also staff, people who know how to fix things and not just one

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.980
person because people go on vacation or sleep through emergency pager alerts.
