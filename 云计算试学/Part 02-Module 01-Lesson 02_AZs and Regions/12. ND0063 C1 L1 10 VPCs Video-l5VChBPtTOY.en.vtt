00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.710
The term Virtual Private Cloud,

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.680
or VPC for short, sounds pretty intimidating.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.730
Really, every part of the acronym is a little intense.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.800
Virtual, private, and cloud all have a lot of connotations.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.065
So what is a VPC?

00:00:16.065 --> 00:00:19.410
If you've configured a traditional network infrastructure,

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.060
you'll find VPCs fairly familiar.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.880
A VPC is primarily a network.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.160
It's virtual because any resource you create in AWS is virtual.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.685
It's private because it's yours.

00:00:32.685 --> 00:00:34.840
Just like a physical network that you own,

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.910
you control what goes in and out of the network,

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.555
and you decide where to put your service within the network.

00:00:41.555 --> 00:00:44.255
The cloud part is really redundant to virtual,

00:00:44.255 --> 00:00:46.565
and it just makes it sound extra special.

00:00:46.565 --> 00:00:51.410
VPCs are isolated private networks that are

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.860
customizable to your needs and are region-specific.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.690
There are some aspects of VPCs that are

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.655
more AWS constructs than they are strictly networking.

00:01:03.655 --> 00:01:05.615
Security groups, for example,

00:01:05.615 --> 00:01:09.190
are similar to firewalls but not exactly the same.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.470
The way that traffic gets into and out of

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.795
a VPC is a little different, similar but different.

00:01:16.795 --> 00:01:22.485
AWS provides constructs to allow traffic from the Internet directly to your service,

00:01:22.485 --> 00:01:28.570
or you can have traffic flow outbound through network address translation devices.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.345
We'll look more at this later.

00:01:30.345 --> 00:01:32.820
You can connect VPCs together.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.840
You can peer two VPCs in your account even if they're in different regions.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.935
You can connect two VPCs from different AWS accounts,

00:01:42.935 --> 00:01:46.300
although, obviously, you should be cautious about doing this.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.020
How many VPCs you use is up to you.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.575
Depending on what network components you use,

00:01:53.575 --> 00:01:56.665
a VPC can have almost no cost.

00:01:56.665 --> 00:02:01.255
Given this, you have a lot of freedom to decide what makes sense for you.

00:02:01.255 --> 00:02:04.960
If you're running your application in one region,

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.714
you can run a fully multi AZ mode with just one VPC.

00:02:09.714 --> 00:02:16.389
Having one VPC per region is actually the default setup within AWS.

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:21.220
AWS now creates a default VPC for you in every region.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.795
However, you can delete this if you desire.

00:02:23.795 --> 00:02:26.925
You can have multiple VPCs per region.

00:02:26.925 --> 00:02:31.260
You can treat multiple VPCs as entirely standalone networks,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.740
or you can connect them together to form a larger network hierarchy.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.760
Really, you can combine VPCs in just about any way that you would like.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.170
You can also connect your office or data center directly to

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.185
your VPC and thus extend your office network into AWS.

00:02:50.185 --> 00:02:53.630
So what things are in a VPC?

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.005
Anything that is instance-based will run inside of VPC.

00:02:59.005 --> 00:03:04.530
For example, RDS, ElastiCache, DocumentDB,

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.690
Elasticsearch, EMR, EC2, Load Balancers,

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.745
Neptune, Redshift, lots of things.

00:03:12.745 --> 00:03:16.010
What are the things that do not run inside of a VPC?

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:22.025
The more service-oriented AWS services tend to not run in a VPC.

00:03:22.025 --> 00:03:26.895
Any of the global services as well as several core services,

00:03:26.895 --> 00:03:34.045
such as SNS or SQS are actually services that are accessed directly over the Internet.

00:03:34.045 --> 00:03:40.130
Some of these include S3, DynamoDB, CloudFront, SNS,

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.625
SQS, SES, Route 53,

00:03:43.625 --> 00:03:47.880
API Gateway, IAM, and Cloud Trail.
