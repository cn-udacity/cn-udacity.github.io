00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.185
In this exercise, you'll be asked to create and run

00:00:04.185 --> 00:00:08.745
a lambda function and then monitor it with CloudWatch metrics.

00:00:08.745 --> 00:00:12.730
Let's take a look at how to create and run a lambda function.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.560
In the lambda service, we create function,

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.545
we can author it from scratch,

00:00:19.545 --> 00:00:22.630
we give our function a name,

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.085
we can pick our runtime.

00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:28.620
For this example, it doesn't make a whole lot of difference.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.360
If you're comfortable with the language,

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.490
you can feel free to do that.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.385
We'll just use node,

00:00:33.385 --> 00:00:36.395
and then we create the function.

00:00:36.395 --> 00:00:38.690
Once our function is created,

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.170
what we want to do is configure a test event.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.215
As we look and see,

00:00:44.215 --> 00:00:47.705
a newly created lambda function will have some boilerplate code.

00:00:47.705 --> 00:00:49.320
That doesn't really do much.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.035
It will print out a log message, and that's all it does.

00:00:52.035 --> 00:00:54.795
That's all we need to do in this exercise.

00:00:54.795 --> 00:00:59.165
What we want to do now is actually invoke the lambda function.

00:00:59.165 --> 00:01:02.845
We can do this through the lambda user interface.

00:01:02.845 --> 00:01:05.890
To do this, we have to set up a test event.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.935
We click this drop down next to the test button,

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:11.540
see the configure test events.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.850
Doesn't make a whole lot of difference.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.410
What we put in that, this would be the data that's passed into our lambda.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.680
Again, because we have a boilerplate lambda that's not actually doing any work,

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.000
it doesn't really matter what we put here.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.990
Let's just name it and then we'll save this test event.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.350
Once we do that, we can see that the name that we provided is in the drop-down.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.160
Then all we have to do is simply click the test button.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.475
We'll see that the lambda user interface will tell us that the execution was successful.

00:01:42.475 --> 00:01:45.795
This is now run the lambda function one time.

00:01:45.795 --> 00:01:48.710
If we keep clicking on the test button,

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.670
it will just keep invoking the lambda function.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.105
For the exercise, you'll want to run the lambda several times,

00:01:56.105 --> 00:02:00.965
give it a few minutes to let the logs and metrics actually propagate,

00:02:00.965 --> 00:02:06.120
and then you want to head over to CloudWatch and look for the metrics there. Good luck.
