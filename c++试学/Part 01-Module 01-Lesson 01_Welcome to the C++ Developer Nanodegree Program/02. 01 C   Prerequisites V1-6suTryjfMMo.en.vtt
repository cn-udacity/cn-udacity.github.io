The prerequisites for this Nanodegree program,
这个 Nanodegren 计划的必备条件

00:00:02.895 --> 00:00:07.650
are that you should be an intermediate level software programmer in any language.
您应该是任何语言的中级软件程序员 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.745
As long as you know concepts like variables, conditionals,
只要你知道变量 条件 

00:00:11.744 --> 00:00:16.214
loops, and functions, you're ready to learn C++.
循环 功能 您已准备好学习 C++ 

00:00:16.214 --> 00:00:21.120
We also expect that you know how to execute programs ideally from the terminal,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.984
and that you're familiar with software debugging.
你熟悉软件调试

00:00:23.984 --> 00:00:27.079
It will be helpful if you're familiar with concepts
熟悉概念会有帮助的

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:29.734
like classes in object-oriented programming,
比如面向对象程序设计中的类

00:00:29.734 --> 00:00:31.789
but that's not required.
但这不是必需的

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.210
If you feel like you need to learn a little bit more about
如果你觉得需要多了解一点

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.914
software programming before proceeding on with this Nanodegree,
软件编程 然后再继续此 Nanodegres  

00:00:38.914 --> 00:00:43.820
then I suggest either Udacity's intro to programming Nanodegree program,
那我建议要么 Udacity 简介 Nanodegres 节目

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.344
or our intro to self-driving cars Nanodegree program.
或者我们的自驾汽车 Nanodegres 计划

00:00:47.344 --> 00:00:50.269
Our intro to programming Nanodegree program
我们的 intro 编程 Nanodegres 程序

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.165
will teach you the basics of software engineering,
会教你软件工程的基础知识

00:00:53.164 --> 00:00:56.284
and our intro to self-driving cars Nanodegree program
还有我们的自驾汽车 Nanodegren 计划

00:00:56.284 --> 00:00:59.149
will teach you the basics of software engineering,
会教你软件工程的基础知识

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:06.429
C++ specifically, along with topics like machine learning, physics, and mathematics.
