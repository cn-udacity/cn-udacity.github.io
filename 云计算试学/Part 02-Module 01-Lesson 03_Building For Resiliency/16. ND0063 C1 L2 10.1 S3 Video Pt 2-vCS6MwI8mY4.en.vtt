00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.195
Standard storage is standard.

00:00:03.195 --> 00:00:07.695
If you have objects that you will access regularly, keep them here.

00:00:07.695 --> 00:00:11.785
Infrequently accessed or IA is a great option

00:00:11.785 --> 00:00:16.445
for important data that you will use occasionally, but not frequently.

00:00:16.445 --> 00:00:19.750
You access the data in the exact same way,

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.820
but you are charged less for storage and more for accessing the objects.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.855
Thus, if you don't access these objects often you will save money.

00:00:29.855 --> 00:00:34.120
If you don't know what your access patterns will be for your data,

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.910
you can use intelligent tiering.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.300
This automatically moves objects between

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.675
standard and infrequently accessed to help you optimize costs.

00:00:44.675 --> 00:00:48.275
Glacier is called glacier to imply

00:00:48.275 --> 00:00:53.720
colder storage or storage that is not as immediately accessible.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.720
This is a good choice for backups or data that you're unlikely to need often.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.845
This option is less expensive than standard warmer storage classes.

00:01:03.845 --> 00:01:08.375
Glacier deep archive is even colder storage.

00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:15.440
Again, best for items that you need to keep but may never or very rarely access.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.035
This storage tier can take up to 12 hours to give you access to your data,

00:01:21.035 --> 00:01:24.810
but again, this tier cost even less.
