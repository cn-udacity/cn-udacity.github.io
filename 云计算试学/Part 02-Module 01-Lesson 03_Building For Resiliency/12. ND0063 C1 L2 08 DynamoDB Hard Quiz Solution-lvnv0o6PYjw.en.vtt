00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.985
Which are true about DynamoDB Streams?

00:00:02.985 --> 00:00:08.040
DynamoDB Streams include all of the changes that happen to a DynamoDB table.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.790
This includes: creates, updates and deletes.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.120
DynamoDB Streams are used as part of

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.160
DynamoDB global tables and they can be used to stream across regions.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.590
However, DynamoDB Streams are not necessary for backing up a DynamoDB table.
