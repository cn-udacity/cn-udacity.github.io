00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
Which window will be most acceptable for

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.675
an international business application to have scheduled downtime?

00:00:06.675 --> 00:00:11.190
The answer is, the first Saturday of the month from 1:00-4:00 AM.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.380
The things we want to consider here are,

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.790
what is our user base,

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.460
and when are they likely to be using our application?

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.490
Because we're talking about international customers,

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.745
we should be very careful when assuming thing about time zones.

00:00:23.745 --> 00:00:26.985
However, since we're talking about a business application,

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:31.300
we can't assume things about the workweek versus the weekend.
