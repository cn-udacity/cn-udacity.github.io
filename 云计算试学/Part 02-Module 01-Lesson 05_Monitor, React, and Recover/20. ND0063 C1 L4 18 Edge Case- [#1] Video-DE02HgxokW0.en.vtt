00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.055
Many applications and services lend themselves for monitoring and maintenance.

00:00:05.055 --> 00:00:10.035
When you run into an application that does not is no less important to monitor,

00:00:10.035 --> 00:00:12.315
alert, and maintain these applications.

00:00:12.315 --> 00:00:14.550
It's probably more important.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.820
You may find yourself needing to go to extremes in

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.050
order to pull these systems into your monitoring framework.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.140
But if you do not,

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.140
you're putting yourself at risk for letting faults go undetected.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.830
If you don't monitor all of your components may wind up with

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.210
your customers being the ones who tell you that some part of your system is down.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.870
This is something that you can and must avoid.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.755
Insuring coverage of all the components of your platform.

00:00:42.755 --> 00:00:45.530
Documenting and training staff to understand

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.475
the platform and practicing what you do in case of outages,

00:00:49.475 --> 00:00:53.340
will help ensure the highest up-time for your company.
