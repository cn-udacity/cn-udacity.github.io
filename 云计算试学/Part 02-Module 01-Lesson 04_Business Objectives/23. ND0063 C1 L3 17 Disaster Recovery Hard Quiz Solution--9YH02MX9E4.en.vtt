00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.305
How can we have CloudFront fail over to a different AWS region?

00:00:04.305 --> 00:00:08.115
In order to automatically failover to a different AWS region,

00:00:08.115 --> 00:00:10.830
we should use CloudFront's origin groups.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.520
This will allow CloudFront to decide if it should follow

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:20.160
a primary S3 bucket or failover to a secondary S3 bucket based on the availability.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.040
We could use multiple distributions or

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.175
multiple origins within our CloudFront distribution,

00:00:26.175 --> 00:00:27.705
but this would still require

00:00:27.705 --> 00:00:32.170
manual intervention to actually cut these over in a DR event.
