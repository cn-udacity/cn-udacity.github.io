00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.015
But you never thought of the a redundant umbrella.

00:00:03.015 --> 00:00:09.025
Most AWS services are either inherently redundant or can be configured to be redundant.

00:00:09.025 --> 00:00:11.670
It will be important that you learn to recognize which

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.405
services come redundant by default and which do not.

00:00:15.405 --> 00:00:19.635
Most services have a varying degree of redundancy.

00:00:19.635 --> 00:00:24.270
You can make cost versus benefit decisions for your use case.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.870
Sometimes, high availability is absolutely critical.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.585
Sometimes, it's just nice to have,

00:00:30.585 --> 00:00:32.830
and sometimes it's unnecessary.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.985
Costs often plays a factor in these decisions.

00:00:35.985 --> 00:00:40.100
To have a service run in a ultra redundant, active,

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.165
active multi-region configuration always cost more

00:00:44.165 --> 00:00:48.965
than running it on a single application server in one availability zone.

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:51.140
There are circumstances for both.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.025
You must decide and be able to justify that decision.

00:00:55.025 --> 00:00:59.580
Also, consider what is required for a given use case.
