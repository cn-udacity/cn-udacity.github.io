00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.375
In this exercise, you are asked to set up a Lambda function,

00:00:04.375 --> 00:00:06.250
invoke that Lambda function,

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.475
and set up an alert on the running of that Lambda function.

00:00:10.475 --> 00:00:13.515
Here we have a Lambda function setup.

00:00:13.515 --> 00:00:16.845
We can invoke this Lambda function,

00:00:16.845 --> 00:00:20.635
and within CloudWatch alarms,

00:00:20.635 --> 00:00:24.635
we have an alarm setup on the execution of this Lambda function.

00:00:24.635 --> 00:00:29.500
We can see, we've got our namespace setup for AWS Lambda,

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.035
the function name that we've invoked; Udacity,

00:00:33.035 --> 00:00:36.000
the metric name, invocations,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.580
and we're looking at the one minute average.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.660
We've just invoked our Lambda function,

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.940
and it may take a minute or two for the alarm to trigger as

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.400
the alert has to consume the metrics from CloudWatch metrics and then trigger the alert.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.610
As we can see, after a minute,

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.320
the alarm has triggered,

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.995
we can see in the left upper corner,

00:01:05.995 --> 00:01:07.870
we've got our alarm has turned red.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.240
We can see in the graph that we're looking at,

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.475
in the upper right-hand corner of the graph,

00:01:12.475 --> 00:01:14.485
it shows us that it's in alarm,

00:01:14.485 --> 00:01:17.470
and the configurations that we've set

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.130
up for e-mail or any other activities will now have triggered,

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.120
and will be alerted to this issue that just happened with our metrics.
