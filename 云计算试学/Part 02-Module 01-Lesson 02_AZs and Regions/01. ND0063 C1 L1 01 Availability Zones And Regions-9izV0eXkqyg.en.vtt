00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
Availability Zones or AZs and Regions are

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.635
the core components within AWS that allow local and global redundancy.

00:00:07.635 --> 00:00:10.770
Proper usage of these key resources is crucial for

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.220
anyone building high availability systems on AWS.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.120
An AWS region contains multiple availability zones.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.600
These availability zones allow for fault isolation within

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.820
a region and provide the simplest way to achieve a significant level of redundancy.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.730
The AWS global infrastructure is made up of

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.120
multiple geographic regions spread around the world.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.410
These regions are connected via high speed private network,

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.690
but the regions themselves are independent.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.430
Availability Zones and regions our containers for AWS networking.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.985
Networking in AWS is setup via

00:00:46.985 --> 00:00:52.990
isolated Virtual Private Clouds or VPCs that exist in one AWS region.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.405
You will get to see how you can have multiple of

00:00:56.405 --> 00:01:02.065
your own custom networks within AWS allowing you complete control and security.

00:01:02.065 --> 00:01:04.600
In this lesson, we will explore VPCs

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.940
themselves and also the networking that is configured within them.
