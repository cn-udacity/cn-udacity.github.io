00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.615
If the cause of an issue is not immediately obvious,

00:00:03.615 --> 00:00:07.545
what things should you look at to help you identify the root cause?

00:00:07.545 --> 00:00:09.855
The answer is, you should look at

00:00:09.855 --> 00:00:13.675
the recent changes that have been made and your documentation.

00:00:13.675 --> 00:00:16.605
Changes that occurred several weeks ago are

00:00:16.605 --> 00:00:20.490
unlikely to be affecting a newly occurring problem.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.680
While the AWS bill,

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.765
does contain a lot of useful information,

00:00:24.765 --> 00:00:28.239
it is not likely to help you in this situation.
