00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.470
Congratulations.

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:03.070
You've made it through the course material.

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.230
I hope you had some fun.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.965
You've seen, learned, and done a ton,

00:00:07.965 --> 00:00:10.140
and now you are well prepared to take on

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.085
the course project where you'll build geographically distributed,

00:00:14.085 --> 00:00:16.140
highly available, highly redundant,

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.540
and resilient systems on AWS.
