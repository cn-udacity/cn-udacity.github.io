00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.690
It is important to think about needs versus wants.

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.340
As you learn about the capabilities of AWS for reliability and redundancy,

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.410
it is important to consider what level of

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.965
availability is required for a use case or environment.

00:00:13.965 --> 00:00:17.250
Some non-critical cases require no redundancy,

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.080
while production environments typically require significant levels of redundancy.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.470
In most cases, redundancy has cost.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.660
Depending on the services you use,

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.460
redundancy can cost a lot.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.130
Typically, redundancy costs at least double.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.449
For example, in RDS,

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:38.125
take the instance cost and double it to have a hot standby,

00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:41.380
triple it to have a read replica in another region.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.220
Review the cost structure for what you're

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.040
building and weigh the costs against the benefits.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.515
Keep in mind that cost comes in multiple forms: there is direct monetary expense,

00:00:50.515 --> 00:00:52.415
as well as the cost of complexity,

00:00:52.415 --> 00:00:55.010
which can take the form of higher learning curves or

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.655
difficulty in monitoring a system or diagnosing a problem.

00:00:58.655 --> 00:01:01.145
When considering how to architect a service,

00:01:01.145 --> 00:01:03.470
you should think about how a disruption

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.410
or data loss in that service would impact your business.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.950
You'll need to think about what it will take to restore service,

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.580
as well as the contractual obligations to which your business has committed.
