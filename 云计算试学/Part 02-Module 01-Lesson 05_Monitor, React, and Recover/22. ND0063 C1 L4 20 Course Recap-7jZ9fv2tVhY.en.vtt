00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.615
We have now completed all the lessons in this course.

00:00:03.615 --> 00:00:07.140
We began by discussing AWS regions and

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.430
availability zones and how they are core to AWS resiliency.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.850
We built VPCs and networks and looked at some of

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.660
the options we have for connectivity within AWS.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.995
Then we studied AWS application service redundancy.

00:00:22.995 --> 00:00:27.380
We learned which types of AWS services offer what levels of

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.395
redundancy and how much effort it takes to achieve those levels of redundancy.

00:00:33.395 --> 00:00:40.690
We created multi AZ and multi-region data stores and worked through fail-over scenarios.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.180
Next, we examined business objectives and

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.720
thought about how to interface with other functions of our business,

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:54.740
as well as what key metrics are for both non-technical colleagues as well as customers.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.639
We created SLAs, estimated outage timelines,

00:00:58.639 --> 00:01:00.845
and planned how to handle them.

00:01:00.845 --> 00:01:06.155
Lastly, after gaining knowledge about how to keep our platforms up and running,

00:01:06.155 --> 00:01:09.155
we worked on what to do when those platforms fail,

00:01:09.155 --> 00:01:11.030
how to prepare for it,

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.980
and how to react to it.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.980
This toolkit provides the foundation you need to build resilient cloud applications.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:25.260
You are now ready to start architecting your own highly available solutions in the cloud.
