00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.995
What is S3?

00:00:01.995 --> 00:00:05.385
S3 stands for simple storage service.

00:00:05.385 --> 00:00:08.910
It's one of the first services AWS created.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.490
In S3, you create buckets,

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.080
and in those buckets,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.550
you can store objects.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.345
An object is for most practical purposes, a file.

00:00:18.345 --> 00:00:20.085
How much data can you store?

00:00:20.085 --> 00:00:24.690
There is no limit to the number of objects you can store in a bucket.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.440
People store exabytes of data in S3.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.095
S3 is designed to store any amount of data,

00:00:32.095 --> 00:00:34.535
which is a pretty bold statement.

00:00:34.535 --> 00:00:37.384
S3 like most AWS services,

00:00:37.384 --> 00:00:42.680
is pay-as-you-go, which means they only pay for what you store in S3.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.900
Cost vary on the exact type of S3 storage you use,

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.615
we'll dig in more shortly,

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:57.545
but overall, the most you pay for S3 is under three cents per gigabyte per month.

00:00:57.545 --> 00:01:01.450
As you'll see, you can spend even less than that.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.160
S3 is highly durable.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.865
Durability is different than availability.

00:01:07.865 --> 00:01:14.290
Durability refers to the likelihood that you will lose something stored in S3.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.715
The answer is not very likely.

00:01:17.715 --> 00:01:27.815
Per AWS, S3 is designed to provide 11 nines of durability of objects over a given year.

00:01:27.815 --> 00:01:33.740
This durability level corresponds to an average expected loss of

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:41.035
0.000000001 percent of objects.

00:01:41.035 --> 00:01:47.315
For example, if you store 10 million objects in Amazon S3,

00:01:47.315 --> 00:01:56.295
you can on average expect to incur a loss of a single object once every 10,000 years.

00:01:56.295 --> 00:02:02.645
Not too bad. S3 allows you to replicate your buckets or just part of the bucket.

00:02:02.645 --> 00:02:04.955
This is useful for redundancy,

00:02:04.955 --> 00:02:08.705
but also for applications that have use cases where

00:02:08.705 --> 00:02:13.340
some parts of your application would like to modify objects in different ways.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.885
You can replicate a bucket within the same region in cases where you want to keep

00:02:17.885 --> 00:02:23.665
a clean copy of your uploaded files yet still have a workspace for making changes,

00:02:23.665 --> 00:02:27.710
or you can create a cross-region bucket replica.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.600
A cross-region replica is perfect for multi-region recovery of data.
