In this exercise, we'd like you to take what you know about looping and turtles,

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.155
and draw something of your own.
把你自己的东西画出来

00:00:07.155 --> 00:00:10.919
But specifically, we've given you a list of the colors
但具体来说 我们给了你一份颜色列表

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:14.775
of the rainbow and we'd like you to draw something rainbow colored.
我们希望你能画出彩虹色的东西

00:00:14.775 --> 00:00:19.685
You can use a loop over this list to draw a shape with different colored sides.
您可以在此列表上使用循环来绘制具有不同颜色边的形状 

00:00:19.684 --> 00:00:24.009
Here are just a couple of examples of shapes that you can create with a loop like that.
这里有几个形状的例子 你可以用这样的循环创建 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.070
You could make a hexagon,
你可以做个六角形

whose sides are just different colors,
他们的肤色不同

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.750
or you could take some time and figure out how to
