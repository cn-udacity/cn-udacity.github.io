00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.175
In this exercise, you'll be creating a NAT gateway and associating it with a subnet.
在此练习中 您将创建 NAT 网关并将其与子网相关联 

00:00:05.175 --> 00:00:06.795
In order to do that,
为了做到这一点

00:00:06.795 --> 00:00:09.600
let's take a look at how you would create a NAT gateway.
让我们来看看您如何创建 NAT 网关 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.260
NAT gateways ask you for a couple of options,.
NAT 网关会询问您是否有几个选项 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.030
The first is the subnet.
第一个是子网 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.330
So you'll want to pick the subnet within
所以你要在

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.900
the new VPC that you just created, your public subnet.
您刚刚创建的新 VPC  即公共子网 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.485
The NAT gateway itself sits in a public subnet,
NAT 网关本身位于公共子网中 

00:00:25.485 --> 00:00:29.280
and then it has access to the Internet from there.
然后它就能从那里进入互联网

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.235
To pick your Elastic IP address,
要选择弹性 IP 地址 

00:00:32.235 --> 00:00:34.665
you can allocate a new IP address,
您可以分配新的 IP 地址 

00:00:34.665 --> 00:00:37.665
or if you already have one in your account you can use that,
或者你的账户里已经有一个你可以用这个

00:00:37.665 --> 00:00:42.300
but this is the public address that the NAT gateway itself will use.
但这是 NAT 网关本身将使用的公共地址 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.705
Once you have your NAT gateway,
一旦有了 NAT 网关

00:00:44.705 --> 00:00:47.165
you'll look at your routing tables,
你会看你的路由表

00:00:47.165 --> 00:00:50.015
and you'll look for the routing table that does not have
你会去找那些没有

00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:52.900
an explicit subnet association already.
显式子网关联 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.665
The one that does have the subnet association is the one that's already in use.
具有子网关联的是已在使用的子网关联 

00:00:57.665 --> 00:01:02.040
We take a look at this routing table and then the routes within it.
我们看看这个路由表 然后再看看其中的路由 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:10.650
We'll see that the only route is local route to the CDIR range of the VPC.
我们会看到 唯一的路由是本地路由到 VPC的 CDIR 范围 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.035
From here, we'll add another route,
从这里我们再增加一条路线

00:01:13.035 --> 00:01:15.635
and this second route will be your default route,
第二条路线是你的默认路线

00:01:15.635 --> 00:01:19.680
and it will point at the newly created NAT gateway
它会指向新创建的 NAT 网关
