00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.175
CloudWatch has many components.

00:00:02.175 --> 00:00:03.765
Alerting is one of them,

00:00:03.765 --> 00:00:08.325
although CloudWatch itself does not actually try to get in touch with you.

00:00:08.325 --> 00:00:11.910
CloudWatch integrates with other AWS services,

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.605
and from those services you can take actions to get people out of bed to resolve issues.

00:00:17.605 --> 00:00:23.235
CloudWatch alarms is where you describe the conditions that you want to alert on.

00:00:23.235 --> 00:00:29.345
You can say, if the database CPU utilization goes over 85 percent,

00:00:29.345 --> 00:00:31.060
I want to do something.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.400
CloudWatch alarms is flexible to your needs.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.870
It lets you determine not just what level to alert at,

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.570
but also how to interpret a given metric.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.120
You can describe your alerts in greater detail.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.885
For example, if the database CPU utilization,

00:00:47.885 --> 00:00:54.130
one minute average is over 85 percent for three out of five minutes,

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.815
I want to do something.

00:00:55.815 --> 00:00:57.740
As you build your systems,

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.685
you will need to consider things like momentary spikes of utilization

00:01:01.685 --> 00:01:06.920
and decide if they are impactful or not impactful to your business.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.080
You may be wondering what does do something mean. Good question.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.740
You've reached the, it's time to do

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.105
something point on metric within your system. Now what?

00:01:20.105 --> 00:01:25.510
CloudWatch alarms allows you to trigger an action based on an alert condition.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:31.175
These actions are all centered around sending events to SNS topics.

00:01:31.175 --> 00:01:33.680
Anything you can do with SNS,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.195
you can do with an alert.

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:39.710
SNS allows you to directly send emails or text messages.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.035
It also allows you to trigger Lambda functions and send HTTP requests.

00:01:45.035 --> 00:01:49.175
These last two are key integration points with outside systems.

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:53.180
When something is critical enough that it should wake people up,

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.915
you can use third parties who specialize in doing just that.

00:01:56.915 --> 00:02:02.060
Products like PagerDuty or VictorOps can receive events from SNS.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.115
You can set up support rotations and multiple levels of alerting, mobile app messaging,

00:02:07.115 --> 00:02:09.200
texts, phone calls, etc,

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.830
so that the alarm keeps escalating until someone deals with it.
