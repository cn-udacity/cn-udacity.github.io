What is S3?
什么是 S3?

00:00:01.995 --> 00:00:05.385
S3 stands for simple storage service.
S3 代表简单的存储服务 

00:00:05.385 --> 00:00:08.910
It's one of the first services AWS created.
这是 AWS 创建的第一个服务 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.490
In S3, you create buckets,
在 S3 中 创建存储区 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.080
and in those buckets,
在那些水桶里

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.550
you can store objects.
可以存储对象 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.345
An object is for most practical purposes, a file.
对象是用于大多数实际用途的文件 

00:00:18.345 --> 00:00:20.085
How much data can you store?
您可以存储多少数据 ?

00:00:20.085 --> 00:00:24.690
There is no limit to the number of objects you can store in a bucket.
您可以存储在存储区中的对象数没有限制 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.440
People store exabytes of data in S3.
人员存储 S3 中的数据的 EB  

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.095
S3 is designed to store any amount of data,
S3 旨在存储任何数据量 

00:00:32.095 --> 00:00:34.535
which is a pretty bold statement.
这是一个很大胆的声明

00:00:34.535 --> 00:00:37.384
S3 like most AWS services,

00:00:37.384 --> 00:00:42.680
is pay-as-you-go, which means they only pay for what you store in S3.
是付费的方式 这意味着他们只支付您在 S3中存储的内容 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.900
Cost vary on the exact type of S3 storage you use,
成本因您使用的 S3 存储的准确类型而异 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.615
we'll dig in more shortly,
我们很快就会挖了

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:57.545
but overall, the most you pay for S3 is under three cents per gigabyte per month.
但总体而言  S3 的最高薪酬是每千兆位 / 月三美分以下 

00:00:57.545 --> 00:01:01.450
As you'll see, you can spend even less than that.
正如你所看到的 你可以花更少的钱 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.160
S3 is highly durable.
S3 非常耐用 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.865
Durability is different than availability.
耐久性与可用性不同 

00:01:07.865 --> 00:01:14.290
Durability refers to the likelihood that you will lose something stored in S3.
耐久性指的是您将丢失存储在 S3中的内容的可能性 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.715
The answer is not very likely.
答案不太可能 

00:01:17.715 --> 00:01:27.815
Per AWS, S3 is designed to provide 11 nines of durability of objects over a given year.
每个 AWS S3 被设计成在给定年份提供 11 个物体的耐久性 

00:01:27.815 --> 00:01:33.740
This durability level corresponds to an average expected loss of
此耐久性级别对应于以下项的平均预期损失 :

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:41.035
0.000000001 percent of objects.
0.000000001% 0.000000001% 的物体 

00:01:41.035 --> 00:01:47.315
For example, if you store 10 million objects in Amazon S3,
例如 如果在 Amazon S3 中存储一千万个对象 

00:01:47.315 --> 00:01:56.295
you can on average expect to incur a loss of a single object once every 10,000 years.
你可以平均每 10000 年就会损失一次

00:01:56.295 --> 00:02:02.645
Not too bad. S3 allows you to replicate your buckets or just part of the bucket.
不太坏 S3 允许您复制存储区或仅部分存储区 

00:02:02.645 --> 00:02:04.955
This is useful for redundancy,
这对于冗余非常有用 

00:02:04.955 --> 00:02:08.705
but also for applications that have use cases where
但对于使用情况的应用程序 

00:02:08.705 --> 00:02:13.340
some parts of your application would like to modify objects in different ways.
应用程序的某些部分将以不同方式修改对象 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.885
You can replicate a bucket within the same region in cases where you want to keep

00:02:23.665 --> 00:02:27.710
or you can create a cross-region bucket replica.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.600
A cross-region replica is perfect for multi-region recovery of data.
