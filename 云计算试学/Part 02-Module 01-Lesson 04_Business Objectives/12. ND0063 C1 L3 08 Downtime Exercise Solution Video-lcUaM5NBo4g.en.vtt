00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
All right. Let's take a look at a sample solution for this exercise.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.910
ABC company hosted applications.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.655
ABC company shall provide general platform uptime of 99.9 percent.

00:00:14.655 --> 00:00:19.410
This will exclude regular maintenance window from 01:00 AM-05:00 AM,

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.125
Central Standard Time every Sunday,

00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:25.995
as well as windows from 01:00 AM-05:00 AM on

00:00:25.995 --> 00:00:31.155
other days provided that ABC provides 24 hours of notice.

00:00:31.155 --> 00:00:39.375
Our second component to our SLA is that it's covering a third-party components.

00:00:39.375 --> 00:00:42.915
Some components of our system are beyond our control,

00:00:42.915 --> 00:00:47.525
and thus we can only pass through the provided SLA of these vendors.

00:00:47.525 --> 00:00:50.750
We only work with vendors and provide an SLA of

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.355
99.9 percent or better for all critical services.

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:59.885
The final component of our SLA covers non-critical components.

00:00:59.885 --> 00:01:03.080
Those components deemed non-critical,

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:09.045
listed below are subject to a 95 percent uptime SLA.

00:01:09.045 --> 00:01:11.825
These components are not core to our offering

00:01:11.825 --> 00:01:14.915
but provides certain "nice to have" functionality.

00:01:14.915 --> 00:01:17.675
In cases where these services are not available,

00:01:17.675 --> 00:01:22.980
our platform shall continue to operate and provide core functionality as normal.
