00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.330
Using the right services involves considering their cost and level of redundancy.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.475
This combination can make for odd trade-offs.

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:11.445
For example, you might be better off running

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:17.189
the same lambda function in two different regions than have the same work done twice.

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:19.995
This could be far cheaper than trying to run

00:00:19.995 --> 00:00:23.490
another service in a multi-region configuration.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.744
Once you are familiar with a wide array of AWS services,

00:00:27.744 --> 00:00:31.280
you can use your knowledge of their multi-AZ or

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:38.110
multi-region abilities to select services to achieve your platform's availability needs.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.065
As Dr. Sue says,

00:00:40.065 --> 00:00:41.660
"Think left and think right,

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.160
and think low and think high.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.340
Oh, the things you can think up if only you try."
