00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.390
VPCs are closely related to IP networks.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.655
In order to set up a VPC,

00:00:05.655 --> 00:00:08.605
we need to provide it a network range.

00:00:08.605 --> 00:00:11.790
Let's look briefly at what a network range is.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.830
A network range is a consecutive set of IP addresses.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.295
In order to more concisely describe a network range,

00:00:20.295 --> 00:00:23.370
AWS uses CIDR notation.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:29.325
CIDR is an acronym for Classless Inter-Domain Routing,

00:00:29.325 --> 00:00:32.370
but we don't really need to worry about what all that means.

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.415
CIDR notation is comprised of an IP address,

00:00:36.415 --> 00:00:40.470
followed by a slash, followed by a number.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.030
The IP address is the first address in the network range.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.610
The number after the slash tells us how big the range is.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.605
The smaller the number,

00:00:51.605 --> 00:00:54.640
the more addresses in the network range.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.780
Well, technically we can use any number between zero and 32.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.780
If we stick to 16 or 24,

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.385
things stay a lot simpler.

00:01:04.385 --> 00:01:07.055
If we use /16,

00:01:07.055 --> 00:01:14.495
we use the maximum of the second half of the IP address as the end of the network range.

00:01:14.495 --> 00:01:21.620
So 10.2.0.0/16 goes from

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:28.875
10.2.0.0 to 10.2.245.255.

00:01:28.875 --> 00:01:31.480
If we use a slash 24,

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:37.100
we use the maximum of the last quarter of the IP or

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.450
10.2.0.0/24 would go

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:51.120
from 10.2.0.0 to 10.2.0.255.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.210
The detailed mechanics of using CIDR notation to determine

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.200
a network range involve a topic called bit masking.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.225
That goes beyond the scope of this course.

00:02:01.225 --> 00:02:05.080
For now, you can just remember that /24 means

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.820
255 addresses and /16 means 65,000 addresses.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.770
You may have run into situations where two computers on a network

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.620
try to use the same IP address, things don't go well.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.515
They fight and complain, and no one is happy.

00:02:22.515 --> 00:02:26.530
When two VPCs have overlapping network ranges,

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.835
the concept is basically the same.

00:02:28.835 --> 00:02:35.190
You cannot connect two VPCs that have the same or overlapping network ranges.
