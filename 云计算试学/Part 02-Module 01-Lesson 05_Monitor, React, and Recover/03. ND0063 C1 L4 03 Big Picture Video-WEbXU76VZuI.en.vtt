00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.315
Things break, you should expect things to break.

00:00:03.315 --> 00:00:06.780
Ask yourself, what will you do when things break?

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.745
The more successful you are,

00:00:08.745 --> 00:00:10.450
the larger your platform will grow.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.970
The larger it grows,

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.950
the more components it will have,

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.620
and the higher the likelihood that something will fail,

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.500
and the more important the system is,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.090
the bigger the problem that is,

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.780
when it does fail, don't be surprised when things break.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.050
Expect it and prepare for it,

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.280
make sure that you create systems that are observable and that you then observe them.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.445
But you can't just have a system that you actively watch.

00:00:36.445 --> 00:00:39.330
You need to create active monitoring that will

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.385
alert you in the middle of the night when things go wrong.

00:00:42.385 --> 00:00:45.745
Monitoring and alerting are your eyes and ears.

00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:50.435
Monitoring is your ability to see what's going on within your systems,

00:00:50.435 --> 00:00:55.105
and alerting is your ears allowing you to hear about serious issues.

00:00:55.105 --> 00:00:59.585
Reacting to failure means taking the steps necessary to recover,

00:00:59.585 --> 00:01:01.055
get the lights back on,

00:01:01.055 --> 00:01:02.630
and return things to normal.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:08.310
Doing so quickly and efficiently is the key to meeting your business objectives.
