00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.380
In this course project,

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.070
you'll build a Multi-Availability Zone Multi-Region Database.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.990
You'll then demonstrate how to use

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.710
this database across these geographic regions and finally,

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.945
you'll then fail that database over from one geographic location to another.

00:00:15.945 --> 00:00:19.620
You'll also create aversion website and demonstrate

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.340
how its protected from accidental or intentional disruption.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.635
You'll practice by rolling back

00:00:25.635 --> 00:00:29.740
the website to previous version to restore normal operation.
