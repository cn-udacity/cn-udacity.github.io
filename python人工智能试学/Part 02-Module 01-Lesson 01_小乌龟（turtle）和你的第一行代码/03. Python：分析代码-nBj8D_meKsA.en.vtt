00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.070
Let's take a look at this code starting at the top with the very first line,
让我们看看这个开头开头的代码

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.890
import turtle. Now what could that mean?

else like importing cookies from Denmark or coffee from Peru,

this imaginary robot that can draw on the screen.

So, maybe this line is bringing us a turtle from somewhere.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.940
For now, you probably have no idea where

it's probably not from Peru.

Next, the story seems to be introducing a character named George.

equal to a turtle or maybe a double turtle.

00:00:49.265 --> 00:00:52.895
Let's experiment with the code and see what we can figure out.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.675
yet is to try changing things and see what happens.
但要试着改变事情看看会发生什么

00:00:59.674 --> 00:01:01.399

any particular reason this turtle has to be named George.
