00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
In this exercise, you're asked to compute what an RTO might be for a given situation.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.725
Let's take a look. At time zero, the problem occurs.

00:00:10.725 --> 00:00:16.665
If it takes five minutes for an amount of time to pass before an alert is triggered,

00:00:16.665 --> 00:00:20.415
another minute to actually trigger on call staff,

00:00:20.415 --> 00:00:25.300
10 minutes to get staff out of bed to get their computers to log on.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.810
Another 10 minutes before they can really start diagnosing the issue,

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.825
15 minutes to discover the root cause,

00:00:32.825 --> 00:00:36.095
five more minutes to begin remediation,

00:00:36.095 --> 00:00:40.040
and another 10 minutes to actually have that remediation completed,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.420
looking at a total time of 56 minutes.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.409
In this case, an RTO of one hour for this incident would be reasonable.
