Which are true about availability zones.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.710
The correct answer is the number of availability zones does vary per region.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.665
You really don't need to be concerned about the latency

00:00:10.665 --> 00:00:13.725
between availability zones as it's very low.

00:00:13.725 --> 00:00:18.915
AZs are in physical separate locations separated by miles.

00:00:18.915 --> 00:00:21.959
Unfortunately, not all [inaudible] services

00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:26.130
automatically use all or even multiple availability zones.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.260
You'll learn more about setting this up later.
