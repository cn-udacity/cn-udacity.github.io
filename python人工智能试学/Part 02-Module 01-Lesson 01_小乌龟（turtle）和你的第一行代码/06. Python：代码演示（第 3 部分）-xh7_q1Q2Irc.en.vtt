00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.844
Next, we have the line for side in [1, 2,
接下来 我们在 [ 1  2  

00:00:04.844 --> 00:00:08.519
3, 4]: Notice also that this line ends in

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.494
a colon and there are two lines indented underneath it.

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:32.189
Now, go back and run this program again but this time watch the turtle closely

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.649
with these lines of code in mind and try
用这些代码来尝试

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.439
to see what these lines are making the turtle do.
