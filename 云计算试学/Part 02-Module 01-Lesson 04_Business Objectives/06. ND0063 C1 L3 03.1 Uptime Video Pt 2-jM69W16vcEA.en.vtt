00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
Be very cautious when it comes to committing to uptime numbers.

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.330
Do the math and make sure that you can reasonably achieve the numbers being asked for.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.810
Allow downtime will be the number of minutes that

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.410
you are allowed to be down without violating your SLA.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.570
Allow downtime is typically measured on a monthly basis.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.355
Since different months have different lengths,

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:28.005
SLAs often use a 30-day measurement to calculate downtime,

00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:30.660
even for months that have a different number of days.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.435
Let's get out the calculator and do some math.

00:00:33.435 --> 00:00:39.430
How much downtime would a 99 percent SLA allow for?
