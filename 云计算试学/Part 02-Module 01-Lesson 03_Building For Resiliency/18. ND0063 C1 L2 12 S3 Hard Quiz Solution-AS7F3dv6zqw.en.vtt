00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.375
What can you do with an S3 lifecycle policy?

00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:05.220
With a lifecycle policy,

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.790
you can move objects between storage tiers in S3.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.915
You can also use the lifecycle policy to delete objects.

00:00:12.915 --> 00:00:19.785
However, you cannot use an S3 lifecycle policy to move objects between AWS services,

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:23.380
nor can you use it to compress those objects.
