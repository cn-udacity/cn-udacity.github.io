00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.045
It's time for the course project.

00:00:03.045 --> 00:00:06.135
In this project, you'll practice setting up

00:00:06.135 --> 00:00:11.460
an RDS database in a multi-availability zone, multi-region configuration.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.380
You'll connect to the database in each region and make sure that you're able to use it.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.020
Then we'll practice a failover,

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.890
and failover that database from one region to the other,

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.720
and then see how it reconnect

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.190
our application to the newly created database in the separate region.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.345
In the second part of the project,

00:00:31.345 --> 00:00:35.615
you'll set up a website based on an versioned S3 bucket.

00:00:35.615 --> 00:00:38.390
Then we'll see how versioning works and how it can

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.645
help you restore prior versions of your website.

00:00:41.645 --> 00:00:45.755
You'll see how any accidental changes can be automatically

00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:50.860
undone by rolling back to previous version of objects in your S3 bucket.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.080
This project will be a great way for you to demonstrate

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.319
your newly understood knowledge of building highly available,

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:02.460
redundant, and resilient systems on AWS. Good luck.
