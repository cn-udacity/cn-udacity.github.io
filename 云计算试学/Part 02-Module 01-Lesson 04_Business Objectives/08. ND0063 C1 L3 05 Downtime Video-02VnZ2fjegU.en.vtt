00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.550
Isn't downtime just the opposite of uptime?

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.445
Why should we talk about it as a separate topic?

00:00:05.445 --> 00:00:08.340
Downtime has some important caveats.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.180
Most platforms are not entirely within your control.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.515
You might use third-parties for aspects of your platform,

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:17.195
such as email delivery,

00:00:17.195 --> 00:00:20.345
video streaming, data collection, and hosting.

00:00:20.345 --> 00:00:22.805
Do any of these sound familiar?

00:00:22.805 --> 00:00:24.725
Certainly at a minimum,

00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:26.605
you know about AWS.

00:00:26.605 --> 00:00:28.740
What if AWS goes down?

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.854
How can it be expected to account for all of these services?

00:00:32.854 --> 00:00:34.955
You don't run them all yourself,

00:00:34.955 --> 00:00:37.685
so you can't personally keep them up and running.

00:00:37.685 --> 00:00:43.780
What do you do? You can choose third parties who themselves provide SLAs.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.310
Then in your own contracts,

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:52.040
you can specify that you only use third parties with a minimum SLA threshold,

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.555
but that you are not responsible for the third party downtime.

00:00:56.555 --> 00:00:58.790
Well, at least you can try.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.215
Your customers may not accept that.

00:01:01.215 --> 00:01:04.160
This is where you turn the negotiators within

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.520
your organization to work out all of the details so that

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:14.945
both parties and yourself understand what will and will not be your responsibilities.

00:01:14.945 --> 00:01:17.480
Let's talk about some math.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.790
If you provide a 99.9 percent SLAs to your customers and

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.345
your third parties all provide 99.9 percent SLAs to you,

00:01:28.345 --> 00:01:30.795
you should be covered, right?

00:01:30.795 --> 00:01:36.470
Only if all of that downtime completely overlaps.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:43.040
If you happen to use all of your allotment of downtime in a month and even one of

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.860
your third parties uses any of

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.505
their allotment and their downtime doesn't fall within your downtime,

00:01:51.505 --> 00:01:55.505
you just missed being up for 99.9 percent of the month.

00:01:55.505 --> 00:02:00.740
Obviously, this problem just gets bigger as more third-parties that you use.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.120
But doing away with third parties is likely not practical either.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.290
So make sure you covered this case in writing in your agreements.
