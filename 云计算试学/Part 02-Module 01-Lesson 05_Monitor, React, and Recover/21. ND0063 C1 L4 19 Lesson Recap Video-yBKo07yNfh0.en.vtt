00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.225
In this lesson, you've worked on monitoring your systems

00:00:03.225 --> 00:00:06.945
and learning about the AWS tools and features for doing so.

00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:12.810
You practiced using CloudWatch metrics to find and view AWS metrics.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.460
Then we looked at the next step to monitoring, alerting.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.120
We created an alert and examined the options that CloudWatch

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.780
alarms gives us for bringing attention to problems.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.385
Once our systems reach out and ask for help via our alerting,

00:00:29.385 --> 00:00:31.260
we need to take action.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.980
We've looked at the steps involved in diagnosing problems,

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.460
how to consider these from the beginning of system design,

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.815
and how to bring systems back online.

00:00:41.815 --> 00:00:45.290
Finally, we discussed automating the recovery of

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.400
our systems and the benefits and considerations in doing so.
