00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
In this exercise, you are asked to create

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.710
a DynamoDB table and then transform that table into a global table.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.040
You can see here we've created a DynamoDB table with has some basic details, table name.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.725
Then we set up our primary partition key.

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:20.715
Then we have also enabled streaming on the table,

00:00:20.715 --> 00:00:23.655
which is a requirement for global tables.

00:00:23.655 --> 00:00:27.315
We move down to our Global Table's tab.

00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:32.360
We can see that we now have the option to add a region to our table.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.900
We add the region by selecting whichever region where we'd like to replicate to.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.905
AWS tells us that that region is ready and available,

00:00:42.905 --> 00:00:45.560
and we create a replica.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.100
Once this finishes, we'll have a global table that is

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.880
writable in multiple regions, and there we go.
