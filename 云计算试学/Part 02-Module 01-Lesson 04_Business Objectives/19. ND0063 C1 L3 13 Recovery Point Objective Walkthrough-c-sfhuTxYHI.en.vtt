00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
In this exercise, you'll be asked to create an RDS database with backups enabled and then

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.660
restore that database to a point in time to demonstrate a point in time recovery.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.110
Let's take a quick look at how to create this database.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:22.140
Within AWS, we go into RDS and we create a database.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.360
RDS will ask us,

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.150
we want a standard or easy create.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.160
Doesn't make a whole lot difference, we'll say standard.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.214
We are going to create a MySQL database,

00:00:33.214 --> 00:00:37.385
scroll through a fair number of options.

00:00:37.385 --> 00:00:39.785
You can say dev test,

00:00:39.785 --> 00:00:43.310
just so that we have a simpler database.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:49.210
We can leave most of these settings as they are for this exercise.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.620
We'll choose a burstable class just to

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.275
save some money because the larger classes will cost more money.

00:00:57.275 --> 00:01:00.560
Then as we scroll all the way down,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.685
we'll see that there is some additional configuration.

00:01:05.685 --> 00:01:07.800
In the additional configuration,

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.655
I just want to make sure that backups are in fact enabled, which is the default.

00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:15.425
Now with the automatic backups enabled,

00:01:15.425 --> 00:01:19.030
this is what enables us to actually do the point in time recovery.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.650
Which is why this is very important for this exercise,

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.105
to make sure that this checkbox is in fact checked.

00:01:25.105 --> 00:01:28.800
From there, we'll create our database.
