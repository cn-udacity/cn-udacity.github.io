00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.595
If we have a turtle called Amy,
如果我们有一只叫艾米的乌龟

00:00:02.595 --> 00:00:09.569
then the statement amy.forward(50) causes that turtle to move forward by 50 pixels.
然后声明 amy.forward (50) 使该海龟向前移动 50 像素 

00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:16.625
Similarly, amy.back(50) causes the turtle to move backwards by 50 pixels.
同样  Amy.back(50) 使海龟向后移动 50 像素 

00:00:16.625 --> 00:00:19.500
One thing that's important to understand when writing
有一件事在写作时很重要

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.554
turtle programs is that the directions are all from the turtles perspective.
海龟的程式 方向都是从海龟的角度出发 

00:00:24.554 --> 00:00:26.550
This can be a little bit confusing at
这可能有点让人困惑

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.984
first when you tell the turtle to turn left or right.
当你告诉海龟左转或右转时

00:00:29.984 --> 00:00:32.723
At any point in the program,
在节目的任何时候

00:00:32.723 --> 00:00:36.334
the turtle is facing in a particular direction.
乌龟正朝着特定的方向前进

00:00:36.335 --> 00:00:39.625
When you tell the turtle to turn left by 45,
当你告诉海龟左转 45

00:00:39.625 --> 00:00:45.700
you're telling it to turn left by 45 degrees from the direction it's currently facing.
你告诉它要从它目前所面对的方向左转 45 度

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.195
So, if we want the turtle to draw a square,
所以如果我们想让海龟画个方形

00:00:49.195 --> 00:00:52.759
we have to tell it to go forward 100 pixels,
我们得告诉它前进 100 像素

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:56.739
then turn left by 90 degrees from its perspective,
然后从它的角度左转 90 度 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.695
forward 100, left 90,
前 100  左 90 

00:00:59.695 --> 00:01:04.105
forward 100, left 90, forward 100,
前 100  左 90  前 100 

00:01:04.105 --> 00:01:09.840
and now it's back to where it started although it's facing in a different direction now.
现在又回到了它开始的地方

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.920
This can sometimes get a little confusing.
这有时会引起一些混乱 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.844
For example, if you want to draw a triangle like this,
比如 如果你想画一个这样的三角形 

00:01:16.844 --> 00:01:20.349
you might be thinking of having the turtle turn by
你可能会想让海龟

00:01:20.349 --> 00:01:24.375
these angles inside the triangle which are 60 degrees.
三角形里面有 60 度角

00:01:24.375 --> 00:01:31.370
But actually, you want to have the turtle turn by these angles which are 120 degrees.
但实际上 你想让海龟以 120 度的角度转动 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.950
Of course, if you get confused or if you're not quite sure,
当然如果你糊涂了或者你不太确定

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.764
you can always experiment.
你总是能做实验

00:01:37.763 --> 00:01:42.119
Don't be afraid to try different angles to see what results you'll get.
不要害怕尝试不同的角度去看你会得到什么结果
