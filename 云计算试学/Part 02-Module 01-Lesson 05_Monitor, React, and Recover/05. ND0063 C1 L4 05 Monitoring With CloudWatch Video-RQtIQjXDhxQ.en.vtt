00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.795
It's not production, if you're not monitoring it. What does that mean?

00:00:03.795 --> 00:00:05.715
It means that you can architect

00:00:05.715 --> 00:00:09.960
the most brilliant systems in the world that serve millions of users every day,

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.135
but if you're not monitoring that system,

00:00:12.135 --> 00:00:16.230
you're begging for a massive outage and you shouldn't be shocked when it happens.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.800
Monitoring systems is not as exciting as designing them,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.110
but it is equally as important.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.310
Highly available, reliable, and resilient systems still fail in

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.340
completely unexpected ways because it's impossible to anticipate every failure path.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.080
Additionally, consider that succeeding can lead to failure.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.440
If your application becomes wildly popular and serves thousands of new users a day,

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.005
this will strain your system in new ways.

00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:50.750
Something that works for 100,000 users may not work as well for a million users,

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.510
and may not work at all for 10 million users.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.610
Without monitoring, you'll miss

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.780
the signs of your system going through these growing panes.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.020
CloudWatch is the primary AWS service for monitoring.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.470
CloudWatch has many pieces that work together to help you

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.920
get an overall view of your platform and services.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.455
CloudWatch metrics are the main repository of monitoring metrics within AWS.

00:01:15.455 --> 00:01:17.720
There are many metrics generated by

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.860
your AWS infrastructure that you can only get from AWS.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.240
What does the CPU utilization look like on your RDS database?

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.105
How many messages are currently in an sqsq?

00:01:29.105 --> 00:01:33.260
These are things that you don't have access to in any other way,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.225
but to ask AWS.

00:01:35.225 --> 00:01:41.240
CloudWatch metrics is where AWS makes all of these type of metrics available to you.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.150
Any metric that AWS tracks for their services are available via CloudWatch metrics.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.385
For any AWS service that you use,

00:01:49.385 --> 00:01:52.370
you should be aware of what metrics are available.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.710
You can also create custom metrics within

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.015
CloudWatch metrics and then use those same tools to track these.

00:01:59.015 --> 00:02:04.765
CloudWatch Logs is a service for storing and viewing text-based logs.

00:02:04.765 --> 00:02:09.330
AWS services that generate text logs: Lambda,

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.310
API Gateway, etc., will automatically log into CloudWatch Logs.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.870
You may also have your custom applications log to

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.160
CloudWatch Logs and use that as your centralized logging system.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.620
CloudWatch Logs Insights is a powerful tool for searching through these logs.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.965
CloudWatch Synthetics are health checks that you can create for your HTTP endpoints.

00:02:33.965 --> 00:02:36.410
If you want to have an overall check on,

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.400
is this service responding correctly to HTTP requests,

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.415
then you can set up a CloudWatch Synthetic that periodically checks that endpoint.

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:52.355
Dashboards are a fantastic way for you to create at a glance views of your system health.

00:02:52.355 --> 00:02:57.455
You probably lack the time to spend hours every day investigating system health.

00:02:57.455 --> 00:03:02.075
Instead, create dashboards that have all of the best indicators

00:03:02.075 --> 00:03:07.360
of system health so they can check them frequently and quickly for performance data.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.170
CloudWatch dashboards is a tool for creating these summarized views.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.315
CloudWatch Alarms is the alerting mechanism for CloudWatch metrics.

00:03:17.315 --> 00:03:20.790
We'll focus on this later in this lesson.
