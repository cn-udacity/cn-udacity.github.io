00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
Now, let's look at how we will instill redundancy in server-based services.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.760
For multi availability zone redundancy,

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.340
you will need to configure a subnet group.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.140
A subnet group consists of

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.245
more than one subnet in which the server is comprised of instances.

00:00:17.245 --> 00:00:21.705
A subnet is associated with only one availability zone.

00:00:21.705 --> 00:00:27.635
So to create a subnet group to support a multi availability zone configuration,

00:00:27.635 --> 00:00:32.350
your subnet group should include subnets from multiple availability zones.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.900
If you run one instance of an application and

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.130
the underlying hardware fails or the availability zone fails,

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.485
your service will become unavailable until

00:00:42.485 --> 00:00:46.310
a new server can be created in a different availability zone.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.275
The time this will take depends on the service and the amount of data that you have.

00:00:51.275 --> 00:00:53.495
Also, depending on the service,

00:00:53.495 --> 00:00:55.250
you may lose some data.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.680
To reduce downtime to seconds you need to create multiple instances.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.785
This takes different forms in different services.

00:01:03.785 --> 00:01:06.770
In ElastiCache, you configure a cluster.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.710
In RDS, you choose a multi-AZ configuration.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.040
The goal in all cases is to create a hot standby that

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.545
has a current copy of your data ready to take over at a moment's notice.

00:01:20.545 --> 00:01:25.205
Yes, sometimes this is all as simple as a checkbox.

00:01:25.205 --> 00:01:29.450
RDS has a create multi-AZ checkbox that will

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.920
create a secondary instance for you with no other effort on your part.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.530
Multi-region redundancy for server-based services is not always easy.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:46.145
Some services such as RDS allow you to create a read replica in another region,

00:01:46.145 --> 00:01:52.105
but you'll have to intervene to switch your platform to use it as a primary database.

00:01:52.105 --> 00:01:56.570
Other services don't actually have any multi-region support.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.630
Elasticsearch, for example, does not have

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.430
provisions for running in a multi-region configuration.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.050
In these cases a common approach is to move backups of the data from

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.630
these services into other regions so

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.005
that the service could be recovered there if necessary.

00:02:15.005 --> 00:02:18.545
Redundancy for these services is not cheap.

00:02:18.545 --> 00:02:20.450
To have redundant server,

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.970
you basically pay double the cost.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.755
Depending on the service,

00:02:24.755 --> 00:02:28.235
you may not even be able to use that secondary instance.

00:02:28.235 --> 00:02:32.450
It will just sit there waiting just in case you ever need it.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.780
This may not sound like a great value proposition,

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.495
but it is the same situation you'd be in if you're running in a data center.

00:02:40.495 --> 00:02:46.955
The only way you have highly available mySQL is if you have two servers.

00:02:46.955 --> 00:02:53.590
Often the technologies we run at AWS are dictated by the needs of our applications.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.295
When this is the case,

00:02:55.295 --> 00:03:01.225
services like RDS make a lot of sense and still provide substantial value.

00:03:01.225 --> 00:03:05.990
Later, we will study other AWS native services that offer

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:11.670
a better pricing model for multi availability zone and multi-region redundancy.
