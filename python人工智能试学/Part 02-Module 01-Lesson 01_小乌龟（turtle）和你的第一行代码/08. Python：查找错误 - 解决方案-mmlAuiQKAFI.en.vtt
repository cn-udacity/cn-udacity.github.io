00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.524
When Python has a problem with your code,
当 Python 有代码的问题时

00:00:02.524 --> 00:00:06.964
it will tell you which line number it was working on when the problem happened.
它会告诉你问题发生时它正在做什么线号 

00:00:06.964 --> 00:00:08.564
In the case of this code,
在此代码的情况下 

00:00:08.564 --> 00:00:11.199
the first problem shows up on line two.
第一个问题出现在第二行

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:14.829
Now by itself, this line of code looks just fine.
现在 这一行代码看起来很不错 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.980
We saw lines of code just like this one before and they worked.
我们看到的代码就像这样 然后他们就开始工作了 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.660
We were able to set turtles colors to be yellow,
我们可以把海龟的颜色设置为黄色

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.625
or green, or whatever we like.
或者绿色 或者我们喜欢的任何东西 

00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:27.420
What's going on here? Why is this lineup problem now?
这是怎么回事 为什么现在这个阵容问题 ?

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.100
Well, normally, Python runs code from top to
通常  Python 运行代码从顶部到

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.285
bottom in the same way that you would carry out a series of instructions.
以同样的方式下底你会执行一系列的指令

00:00:35.284 --> 00:00:37.369
The computer runs line one first,
电脑第一行

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:39.579
then line two and so on.
那就行了

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.835
But, this means that the instructions have to be in the right order.
但是 这意味着指令必须符合正确的顺序 

00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:45.410
If they're in the wrong order,
如果他们的顺序不对

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:47.449
the computer will probably get lost,
电脑可能会丢失

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.380
and that's what's happening here.
这就是这里发生的事情

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.115
Take another look at these first three lines of this program.
再看看这个节目的前三行 

00:00:53.115 --> 00:00:58.335
The program tries to get a turtle named Melinda to do something on line two.
节目试图让一只名叫梅林达的乌龟在两线上做点什么 

00:00:58.335 --> 00:01:03.505
But, we don't actually say to create a turtle named Melinda until line three.
但是 我们并不是说要创建一只名叫梅林达的乌龟 直到第三行 

00:01:03.505 --> 00:01:08.665
The program can't tell Melinda what to do if there isn't a turtle with that name yet.
节目不能告诉梅林达 如果还没有一个有这个名字的海龟 怎么办 ?

00:01:08.665 --> 00:01:11.335
The error message, name error,
错误消息 名称错误 

00:01:11.334 --> 00:01:14.269
will always mean that the code is referring to
通常是指代码是指

00:01:14.269 --> 00:01:17.905
a name that doesn't actually refer to any object yet.
一个还没有提到任何对象的名字

00:01:17.905 --> 00:01:21.320
The rest of the error message tells you exactly what name is
剩下的错误信息告诉你

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:25.154
having the problem and what line in the code it occurs on.
问题以及代码发生在什么代码中 

00:01:25.155 --> 00:01:30.875
So all we need to do to fix this error is to put these two lines into the correct order.
所以我们要解决的问题就是把这两条线输入正确的顺序 

00:01:30.875 --> 00:01:33.644
Once we do that, the code can start running,
一旦我们做到了密码就能开始运行

00:01:33.644 --> 00:01:36.754
at least until the next error happens.
至少在下一个错误发生之前

00:01:36.754 --> 00:01:40.079
Try it then see if you can fix that one too.
试一下 看看你也能修好那个
