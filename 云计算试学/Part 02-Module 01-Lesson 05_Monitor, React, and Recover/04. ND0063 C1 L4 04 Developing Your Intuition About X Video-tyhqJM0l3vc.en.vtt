00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
How much is enough when it comes to monitoring and alerting?

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.765
Any system or component that should it fail,

00:00:06.765 --> 00:00:08.460
would cause serious issues,

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.710
needs, monitoring, and alerting.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.385
Covering 90 percent of your services important components,

00:00:14.385 --> 00:00:17.940
but still leave you blind to 10 percent of the problems that will occur.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.420
Be diligent about identifying critical components,

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.105
and finding ways to monitor and alert on them.

00:00:24.105 --> 00:00:26.445
Monitoring and alerting are critical,

00:00:26.445 --> 00:00:29.085
but once you've been alerted to an issue,

00:00:29.085 --> 00:00:30.450
how do you find that problem?

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.765
Your ability to track down issues, debug problems,

00:00:33.765 --> 00:00:37.245
and get to the root cause of an outage, are equally important.

00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:39.405
When you design and build systems,

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:43.940
make sure that you're thinking from the start about how you would debug your platform.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.830
Include comprehensive logging, make extensive use of metric collection,

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.390
ensure that you can quickly analyze your logs and metrics.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.710
Know what normal looks like as you will then be able to spot the abnormalities.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.055
How do you ensure that you can not only recover from failure,

00:01:01.055 --> 00:01:03.565
but recover quickly and safely?

00:01:03.565 --> 00:01:07.000
How do you know that your database backups are complete?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.105
How do you know that your backup systems will come online?

00:01:10.105 --> 00:01:12.635
Practice. If you don't practice,

00:01:12.635 --> 00:01:16.384
if you don't actually try out your processes and procedures,

00:01:16.384 --> 00:01:21.510
you won't know, and the middle of an outage is the wrong time to find that out.
