00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.005
In this course, you'll use the highly available constructs within

00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:08.175
AWS to create highly available and resilient systems and networks.

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:10.740
You'll build resources in the different regions and

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.550
availability zones that make up the backbone of AWS Cloud.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.875
Next, you'll design and build resilient and scalable solutions within AWS,

00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:25.275
application services that allow for resiliency and geographic scalability.

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:28.185
Then, you'll explore connection between

00:00:28.185 --> 00:00:32.640
all these technical aspects and business operations and objectives.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.505
Understanding this relationship is key to delivering results for the whole organization.

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:42.225
Finally, you'll practice what to do when things fail.

00:00:42.225 --> 00:00:45.540
Things will fail, and here you'll gain knowledge and

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.690
skills to watch for and react to system failures.
