00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.409
In this exercise, you are asked to configure AWS CloudTrail

00:00:04.409 --> 00:00:06.780
so that you can keep track of all the events and

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.500
actions that are happening within your AWS account.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.800
We go to AWS CloudTrail.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.880
We can look at the configured trails.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:26.565
We pick the item that has the name that we have used to create a new trail.

00:00:26.565 --> 00:00:30.680
Now you can see the various options that we've set up for this particular trail,

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.060
whether or not we apply it to all regions and then,

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.570
exactly what events windup going into this particular trail.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.840
Then towards the bottom, we can see what we've configured in

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.140
terms of where to store this particular set of data.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.440
We can see we've stored this in our Udacity Cloud Trail folder.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.055
This is useful for keeping track of large amounts of events.

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:58.820
Also, when you want to go see recent events,

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.220
you can go straight back to the dashboard and under recent events,

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.900
click "View all events".

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.170
Viewing all events gives you a good way to see and search for

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.700
recent events and find out what may have happened most recently within your AWS account.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.630
As you can see, there's lots of data here.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.130
We can expand these and we can get

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.330
more information and see the entire event if we want to.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.890
There's a lot of information and AWS has other tools

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.430
such as AWS Athena to help search through them,

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.130
but using the dashboard is a great way to

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.280
search through and find what's been going on recently in your account.
