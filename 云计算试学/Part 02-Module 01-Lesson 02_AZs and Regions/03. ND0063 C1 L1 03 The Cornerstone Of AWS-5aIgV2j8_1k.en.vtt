00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.820
Regions and availability zones allow anyone to create worldwide infrastructure with ease.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.615
They also allow for redundancy within your platform.

00:00:09.615 --> 00:00:11.835
By properly using these components,

00:00:11.835 --> 00:00:16.410
you can create world-class systems in terms of both scale and reach.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.530
Many organizations build an AWS without

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.115
a firm understanding of region's and availability zones.

00:00:23.115 --> 00:00:27.165
More proficient companies may use availability zones correctly,

00:00:27.165 --> 00:00:28.995
but run only in one region.

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:32.625
By understanding and considering multi-region failover,

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:35.405
or running actively in multiple regions,

00:00:35.405 --> 00:00:39.590
it'll be well on your way to creating an advanced platform on AWS.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.625
[inaudible] AWS region's and availability zones,

00:00:43.625 --> 00:00:46.370
you can create a truly global platform.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.490
You can compete with any other company or service

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.855
in terms of scale, distribution, and performance.

00:00:52.855 --> 00:00:57.010
Many big-name companies are built on AWS.
