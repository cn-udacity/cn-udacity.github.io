00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.610
We've covered a lot of ground in this lesson.

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.355
You've looked at a number of AWS services,

00:00:05.355 --> 00:00:08.520
a few of their abilities and importantly how

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.715
these services can be made multi AZ or multi-region.

00:00:12.715 --> 00:00:17.599
You've seen how server-based services and compute services

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:23.200
get spread out into multiple subnets which lead to multiple availability zones.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.250
You've set up DynamoDB to work in a multi-region mode by working with

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:35.330
global tables and you've used advanced features to manage your data in the multi AZ,

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.100
by default S3 service.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.010
Finally, you worked with AWS compute services to understand how

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.125
to take generic custom servers and run them redundantly as well.

00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:50.810
You should now have a good handle on which

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.485
services are suitable for which type of redundancy needs.

00:00:54.485 --> 00:01:00.580
You've also seen some of the built-in redundancy in AWS native services.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.360
Using this knowledge to select the appropriate services for your use case,

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.535
will save you a lot of time and effort

00:01:07.535 --> 00:01:10.480
instead of trying to use the wrong tool for the job.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.270
We've seen the basics of high availability in AWS and

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.245
now how to build a resilient application services.

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:20.420
Soon, we'll get to considering

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.880
our business goals and then observability and recoverability.
