00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.010
In this exercise, you'll be asked to create an S3 bucket and then apply

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:12.145
an S3 lifecycle policy to that bucket to delete items in it after a number of days.

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:15.260
Here we have an example S3 bucket.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.790
If you'd look at the Management tab within the user interface,

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.380
we'll see that our first option is for Lifecycle.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.900
Underneath we have a Add lifecycle rule button.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.530
Clicking this button, brings us to this wizard for creating a lifecycle rule.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.080
First thing we do is we'll name our rule.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.090
Then we're asked if you want to limit the scope to

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.965
specific subsection of the bucket or just apply this to the entire bucket?

00:00:45.965 --> 00:00:49.010
We're just going apply it to the entire bucket.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:55.235
Next will go onto the second stage of the lifecycle rule wizard.

00:00:55.235 --> 00:00:59.350
The second stage, as we see on the top, is called transitions.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.850
This stage is for transitioning objects from one storage class to another,

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.950
is not about expiring or deleting objects.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.720
So actually we're just going to skip through this step of the wizard.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.150
The third part of the wizard is for expiration.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.955
So this is where we can expire or again,

00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:22.335
delete objects. One last note.

00:01:22.335 --> 00:01:26.090
In this case, we are not talking about a versioned S3 bucket,

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:33.720
so we're only concerned with the current version for this exercise. Good luck.
