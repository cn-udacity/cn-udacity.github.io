00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.075
Here's some code that draws a square.
这里有一些代码绘制一个正方形 

00:00:03.075 --> 00:00:06.980
Notice how we're using the same lines over and over again here,
注意我们如何用同样的线路在这里

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.054
and that's just for a square with four sides.
而这只是一个四方面的正方形

00:00:10.054 --> 00:00:14.085
What if we wanted to draw a shape with say a 100 sides?
如果我们想画出一个 100 面的形状呢 ?

00:00:14.085 --> 00:00:17.820
That's a lot of work and it turns out it's not necessary.
那是很多工作 结果没有必要 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.829
Using a four loop,
用一个四环

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:22.050
we can draw a shape having as many sides as we
我们可以画出像我们一样多边的形状

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.269
want and it will only take three lines of code.
只需要三行代码

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:27.210
To create a for loop,
要创建 for 循环 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.975
we start with a line like this;
我们从这样的线开始

00:00:28.975 --> 00:00:31.990
for side in [1, 2,
在 [ 1  2  

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:42.420
3, 4]: then we follow it with the code that we want to loop or repeat.
3   4 ): 然后我们用我们想要循环或重复的代码来关注它 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.590
Notice how we indented these lines by moving them four spaces to the right.
请注意 我们如何将这些线条缩进到右边的四个空格 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.145
This is how we show that these lines are inside the loop.
这就是我们展示这些线在循环中的方式 

00:00:51.145 --> 00:00:55.850
In other words, it's these indented lines that will get run repeatedly.
换句话说 就是这些缩进的线 会反复运行 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.234
So, this code will run multiple times,
所以这个代码会运行多次 

00:00:59.234 --> 00:01:00.924
but how many times?
但有多少次

00:01:00.924 --> 00:01:06.739
Well, notice the four something in something else structure in this line.
好吧 请注意这一行中其他结构中的四个东西 

00:01:06.739 --> 00:01:09.920
Essentially, it is saying run the code in
基本上它是说运行代码

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.835
this loop one time for each of the things in this list.
对于此列表中的每个内容 此循环一次 

00:01:13.834 --> 00:01:16.299
Since there are four items in the list,
由于列表中有四个项目 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:18.795
the loop runs four times.
循环运行四次 

00:01:18.795 --> 00:01:20.435
For this particular loop,
对于这个特殊的回路

00:01:20.435 --> 00:01:23.320
it doesn't really matter what the items in the list are.
不重要的是清单里的物品是什么

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:26.929
We could change these numbers or even replace them with strings.
我们可以更改这些数字 甚至可以用字符串替换它们 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.710
Again, the loop runs one time for each item in the list
再次 该循环对列表中的每个项运行一次

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:35.359
and it's because there are four items in the list that the loop will run four times.
因为列表中有 4 个项目 循环会运行 4 次
