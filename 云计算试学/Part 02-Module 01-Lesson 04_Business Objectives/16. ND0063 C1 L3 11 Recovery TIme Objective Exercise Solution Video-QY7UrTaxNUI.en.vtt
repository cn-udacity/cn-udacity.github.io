00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
In this exercise, you're asked to compute what an RTO might be for a given situation.
在此练习中 将要求您计算 RTO 可能针对给定情境的内容 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.725
Let's take a look. At time zero, the problem occurs.
我们来看看 在时间为零的情况下 发生问题 

00:00:10.725 --> 00:00:16.665
If it takes five minutes for an amount of time to pass before an alert is triggered,
如果在触发警报之前需要五分钟时间才能传递警报 

00:00:16.665 --> 00:00:20.415
another minute to actually trigger on call staff,
还有一分钟就会触发呼叫人员

00:00:20.415 --> 00:00:25.300
10 minutes to get staff out of bed to get their computers to log on.
10 分把员工从床上取出来让他们的电脑登录

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.810
Another 10 minutes before they can really start diagnosing the issue,
还有 10 分的时间他们才能真正开始诊断这个问题

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.825
15 minutes to discover the root cause,
15 分发现根本原因 

00:00:32.825 --> 00:00:36.095
five more minutes to begin remediation,
再进行五分钟的修复

00:00:36.095 --> 00:00:40.040
and another 10 minutes to actually have that remediation completed,
还有 10 分的修复完成

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.420
looking at a total time of 56 minutes.
总时间为 56 分 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.409
In this case, an RTO of one hour for this incident would be reasonable.
在此情况下 此事件的一个小时的 RTO 是合理的
