Hello. Welcome to the availability,

00:00:02.355 --> 00:00:04.680
reliability, and resiliency course.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.340
My name is Tom [inaudible] and I've been in the software industry for many years,

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.755
as both the developer and an architect.

00:00:10.755 --> 00:00:12.270
In the last 10 years,

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.255
I spent a lot of time working with AWS Ecosystem.

00:00:15.255 --> 00:00:18.209
I built multiple, highly available,

00:00:18.209 --> 00:00:22.095
high-throughput, low-latency systems on top of AWS.

00:00:22.095 --> 00:00:25.510
I'm really excited to get started, so let's go.
