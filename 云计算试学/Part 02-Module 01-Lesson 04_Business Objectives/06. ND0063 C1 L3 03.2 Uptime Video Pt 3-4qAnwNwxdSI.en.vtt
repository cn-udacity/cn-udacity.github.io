00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
The answer is 7.3 hours of allowed downtime per month.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.850
We calculate that by computing the number of minutes in

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.750
a 30-day month and multiplying by one percent,

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.125
which comes from subtracting 100 percent from our SLA of 99 percent,

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:22.200
in order to get how many minutes you're allowed to be down.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.490
Realize that every nine you add is

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.720
an order of magnitude less time that your system can be down,

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.850
and likely at least in order of magnitude harder to actually achieve.
