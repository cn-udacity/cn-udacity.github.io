00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.975
After business objectives had been set and contracts have been signed,

00:00:03.975 --> 00:00:06.450
it's imperative to find ways to make sure that

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.640
your company is diligent about meeting its SLA goals.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.820
When it comes to infrequent events,

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.114
such as disaster recovery failovers,

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:17.085
it can be tempting to deprioritize this work.

00:00:17.085 --> 00:00:19.680
You must be very cautious and make sure that you're spending

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.195
the appropriate time and resources to make sure you maintain these capabilities.

00:00:24.195 --> 00:00:25.835
Depending on your industry,

00:00:25.835 --> 00:00:28.790
your company may be more or less comfortable with

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.525
taking the time and resources to prepare for these types of events.

00:00:32.525 --> 00:00:35.810
If you work for an industry that is government regulated,

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.475
this is probably a fairly common thing within your company and within your industry.

00:00:40.475 --> 00:00:43.820
If you work at a company that is not government regulated,

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.280
your company may be less familiar with taking

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.790
the time and the resources to follow through on these procedures.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.680
But it's still imperative to meet

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.770
your SLAs and the commitments you've made to your customers.
