00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
One area that AWS networking differs

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.425
from a traditional network is in debugging network traffic.

00:00:07.425 --> 00:00:09.435
On a traditional network,

00:00:09.435 --> 00:00:14.205
you could use a packet sniffer to examine the traffic flowing across your network.

00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:19.365
Because of the layers of virtualization that all of the AWS network is built on,

00:00:19.365 --> 00:00:21.370
and for security reasons,

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.430
you are not allowed to examine packets as freely.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.320
AWS has tools and services that aid in the network debugging.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.780
VPC Flow logs show you information about

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.210
network flows which includes the source and destination of a particular traffic flow,

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.465
but not the packets themselves.

00:00:40.465 --> 00:00:43.580
Traffic Mirroring is a recent feature,

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.679
but it does allow for packets inspection,

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:51.330
but it's not quite as simple as putting a network interface into promiscuous mode.
