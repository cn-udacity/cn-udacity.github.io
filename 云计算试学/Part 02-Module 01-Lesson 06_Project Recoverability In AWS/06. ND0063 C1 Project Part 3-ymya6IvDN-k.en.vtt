00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
In the final portion of a project,

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.540
you'll be creating a S3 bucket website.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.705
You'll turn on versioning for that S3 bucket,

00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:13.440
and then go through a series of exercises to learn how and

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.685
demonstrate how you can make changes to a version S3 bucket,

00:00:17.685 --> 00:00:20.985
roll back or complete undo those changes.

00:00:20.985 --> 00:00:24.510
First thing you need to do is create an S3 bucket.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.840
Here I have a bucket and you'll want to set it up so that it can host a website.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.345
So let's look at the properties tab after you create your S3 bucket,

00:00:35.345 --> 00:00:38.500
you see this paying for static website hosting.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.865
You want to enable that, and once you do,

00:00:41.865 --> 00:00:47.760
you'll get a URL where we can then view your website once you put some content into it.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.035
You'll get the content from the course materials in the S3 folder within the project,

00:00:54.035 --> 00:00:57.700
you'll find an HTML file and some graphics.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:04.760
Once you upload these files into the S3 bucket and make sure they're publicly available,

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.650
you'll need to go to the URL that your S3 bucket gives you,

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.180
and it'll looks something like this.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.645
See it's a very simple message and a picture of a winter season.

00:01:17.645 --> 00:01:19.495
You'll see there's a timestamp.

00:01:19.495 --> 00:01:22.340
The timestamp is what the instructor and

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.310
grader will be looking at when it comes to making sure that

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.425
this time series of

00:01:27.425 --> 00:01:33.130
different screenshots that you provide are proceeding in the correct order.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.150
So through the exercise,

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.500
you'll be working with some of the images as well as the index.html

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.110
file to show how different changes take

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.850
effect and to show the different versions of those files look like.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.340
An important thing to note is this bit

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.220
right in the middle at the top in the header bar here is,

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.005
you've got this versions and you have hide and show.

00:01:56.005 --> 00:02:01.445
So the view that we're looking at now is with multiple versions hidden.

00:02:01.445 --> 00:02:05.450
What we just want to do is hit this "Show".

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.575
You can see that the user interface changes a bit, as you now see,

00:02:09.575 --> 00:02:12.335
especially, if you've made any changes to a file,

00:02:12.335 --> 00:02:14.245
you'll see that there are multiple versions.

00:02:14.245 --> 00:02:17.915
This will be key for both this portion of the project

00:02:17.915 --> 00:02:22.770
as well as the materials that you'll submit along with the project when you turn it in.
