00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.285
It costs more to have a highly available platform.

00:00:03.285 --> 00:00:06.555
You pass this cost through to your customers.

00:00:06.555 --> 00:00:12.255
Your customers likely don't use your platform 24 hours a day, every day.

00:00:12.255 --> 00:00:15.630
What should we do then? Scheduled maintenance.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.535
This can be a win-win.

00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:22.935
Do your customers care if your platform is up at 3:00 AM on a Saturday morning?

00:00:22.935 --> 00:00:29.070
They may, or depending on what service your platform offers, they may not.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.990
If you and your customers can agree on certain times

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.085
of day or certain times of day on certain days,

00:00:37.085 --> 00:00:40.415
then you can build in scheduled maintenance.

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:44.890
You can pass on some of that cost savings then to your customers.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.280
Scheduled maintenance is basically a free pass on downtime.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.550
If you agree that your platform can be down every

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.960
Sunday from 1:00 AM to 3:00 AM in a certain time zone,

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.330
then you have a time where you can take care of necessary changes to your platform.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:06.620
This gives you the ability to more easily be up and running during normal business hours.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.940
Thus, you can build

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.435
a less complex and less costly system that meets your customers needs.

00:01:13.435 --> 00:01:17.000
Do your customers need every aspect of your system

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.945
up and running perfectly to get value from your platform?

00:01:20.945 --> 00:01:27.440
It is possible that there are aspects that are not really required but are nice to haves.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:34.735
If so, you can exclude these items from your SLA and make your up time task a bit easier.

00:01:34.735 --> 00:01:40.700
Force majeure, force of nature or act of God are terms used to describe

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.015
things that are beyond anyone's control or beyond any reasonable level of control.

00:01:47.015 --> 00:01:50.225
This term is almost always included in a contract

00:01:50.225 --> 00:01:53.495
as coverage for extraordinary circumstances.

00:01:53.495 --> 00:01:56.960
As we can see, downtime is not so simple.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.880
Given all that we've talked about,

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.935
how do we determine downtime?

00:02:00.935 --> 00:02:04.760
Always put serious thought and consideration into measuring

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.080
your downtime and think about needs like maintenance windows.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.795
Make sure that you know how to calculate

00:02:11.795 --> 00:02:15.550
your downtime before a customer ask the question.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.175
Make sure that the calculation is in writing,

00:02:19.175 --> 00:02:25.140
includes all exclusions, and is referenced in any contracts that you have in place.
