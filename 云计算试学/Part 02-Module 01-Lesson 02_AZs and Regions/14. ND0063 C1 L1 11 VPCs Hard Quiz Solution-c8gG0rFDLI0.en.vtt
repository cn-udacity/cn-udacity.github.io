00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.595
Which are true about a VPC?

00:00:02.595 --> 00:00:07.965
AWS creates a default VPC for you in each region.

00:00:07.965 --> 00:00:10.440
The other answers are not correct.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.185
A VPC can have multiple subnets.

00:00:13.185 --> 00:00:16.275
Two VPCs can't overlap network ranges.

00:00:16.275 --> 00:00:17.910
But if they do overlap,

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.480
you won't be able to pair or connect them to each other.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.965
VPCs aren't directly related to availability zones.

00:00:25.965 --> 00:00:28.450
They are region dependent.
