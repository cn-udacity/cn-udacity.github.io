00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
Generally speaking, resilient systems are more expensive than non-resilient systems.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.025
They can also be more complex to run and maintain.

00:00:08.025 --> 00:00:11.100
Thus, you should consider the trade-offs to

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.100
decide when you need resiliency and when you don't.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.900
Think through the use case and

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.665
business requirements of a particular environment before deciding,

00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:21.900
we should be building out full redundancy.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.785
For development environments, resiliency is usually not needed.

00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:30.160
For mission critical production systems, it's a requirement.
