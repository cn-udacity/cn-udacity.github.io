00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.620
In this exercise, we're setting up a NAT gateway and private subnet.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.995
We can find our NAT gateways in VPC.

00:00:10.995 --> 00:00:16.380
We look at our NAT gateway that is built.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.970
The routing table should have the NAT gateway as the target.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.445
So once we create a NAT gateway,

00:00:23.445 --> 00:00:28.110
we will then want to use and include that NAT gateway within a routing table.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:34.485
So we can see we have a NAT gateway here in our new VPC.

00:00:34.485 --> 00:00:37.990
What we'll want to do is look at our routing tables.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:50.295
We can see that in our routing table that we set up, we have,

00:00:50.295 --> 00:00:53.240
again as we saw in other exercises,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.660
that we've got a local route,

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:03.915
and then we've got the default or the 0.0.0/0 route within our route table,

00:01:03.915 --> 00:01:08.450
this time we're pointing at the NAT gateway that we just took a look at.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.455
Once you've got the route table set up,

00:01:11.455 --> 00:01:15.110
then it's a matter of looking at our subnets and

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.640
having the subnets also set up to use this route table.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.350
So we have a subnet here for this exercise.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.920
Within the subnet view,

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.900
we can look at the route table again to see that

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.285
we're pointing at the route table we just looked at,

00:01:29.285 --> 00:01:34.980
and now anything within this subnet we'll use obviously this route table.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.050
This route table has a default route going through our NAT gateway
