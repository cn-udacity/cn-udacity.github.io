00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.949
The Recovery Time Objective,

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.900
or RTO, is the maximum duration of a service interruption.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.545
This is the time that you agree to in your SLA.

00:00:10.545 --> 00:00:14.910
Of course, it is possible that you will fail to meet your RTO.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.305
In this case, any penalties in your contracts will come into play.

00:00:19.305 --> 00:00:22.260
RTO is similar to uptime,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.330
but it is measured per incident,

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.730
rather than on a monthly basis.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.330
Really, your RTO should be small enough so that

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.539
at least one outage would still fit within your uptime SLA.

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:37.320
Otherwise, you can meet your RTO,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.320
SLA, but still miss your overall uptime SLA.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.325
As with uptime, you need to carefully consider what RTO you can support.

00:00:46.325 --> 00:00:49.190
All of the critical parts of your platform must be

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.945
designed for recovery within your RTO timeframe.

00:00:52.945 --> 00:00:56.645
Lots of things must happen to restore service to your platform.

00:00:56.645 --> 00:00:58.565
When thinking about RTO,

00:00:58.565 --> 00:01:03.830
don't forget about the human factor type of things such as getting people out of bed,

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.230
or searching for the right documentation.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.500
Your RTO should be the sum of the time it takes to

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.000
complete all of the components of a recovery from failure.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.535
If it takes two hours to restore a database from a backup,

00:01:16.535 --> 00:01:19.145
you cannot have a one hour RTO.

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:22.850
Be sure you have plans for staff to be on-call,

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.090
and that those staff know how to recover your systems,

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.500
or at least get in touch with other subject matter experts as needed.
