00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
When looking at your new VPC,

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.470
take note of all the things that are required to create a useful VPC.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.995
You need the VPC itself, a routing table,

00:00:10.995 --> 00:00:16.350
a subnet, and if you want to connect externally, an Internet gateway.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.895
You also need all of these things connected together in the correct way.

00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:23.950
Let's look through the things that have been created,

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.410
and how they relate to each other.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.785
Looking at the newly created VPC,

00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:33.990
we can see a few things about it.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:41.480
In particular, make note of the CIDR address that was picked while we created the VPC,

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.615
in this case, 10.0.0.0/16.

00:00:46.615 --> 00:00:49.005
Next, we'll take a look at the subnet.

00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:52.195
When we look at our subnet list,

00:00:52.195 --> 00:00:57.185
we see all the subnets for all of the VPCs that we have.

00:00:57.185 --> 00:01:01.770
We want to filter this by our newly created VPC.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.080
As we can see, we have one subnet created as part of this VPC.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.015
Now that we're looking at the subnet,

00:01:11.015 --> 00:01:13.590
we can also look at the route table.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.400
Here we can see that both the VPC network address,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.650
10.0.0/16 is in the route table,

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.510
as well as another entry,

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:34.625
the 0.0.0.0/0 entry is really what's called a default route.

00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:37.705
So anything that doesn't match the first role,

00:01:37.705 --> 00:01:40.950
goes to this route entry and

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.475
the target for that is the Internet gateway that was created.

00:01:44.475 --> 00:01:47.880
From here, we can go and look at our Internet gateway.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.350
As we can see, the Internet gateway is attached to our newly created VPC.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.780
All of these elements connected together,

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.560
form a VPC that is actually useful to us where we can put instances in this subnet.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.715
They will then use the associated route table,

00:02:05.715 --> 00:02:08.350
which routes traffic through the Internet gateway,

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:14.340
and thus makes us a publicly accessible subnet within our new VPC.
