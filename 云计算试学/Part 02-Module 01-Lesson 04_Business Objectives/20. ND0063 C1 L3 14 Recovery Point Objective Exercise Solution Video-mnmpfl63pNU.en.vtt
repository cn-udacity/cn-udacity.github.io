00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
In this exercise, you are asked to create an RDS MySQL database with backups enabled,

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.300
and then execute a point in time recovery.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.090
Let's walk through and see how it goes.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.135
We have a database that has been created.

00:00:15.135 --> 00:00:17.969
So if we select our Database,

00:00:17.969 --> 00:00:23.355
go into "Actions" and choose "Restore" to point in time.

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:27.450
When you restore from a snapshot or to a point in time,

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.085
we always get a new database.

00:00:29.085 --> 00:00:31.310
So we don't actually change the running database,

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.560
we get a second database.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.155
So what this is actually asking us is to give it

00:00:36.155 --> 00:00:39.875
information about where to start this new database from.

00:00:39.875 --> 00:00:43.580
So you can see, we can either pick the latest restorable time,

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.440
which is basically now,

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.600
or we can pick a custom time.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.490
So we pick a custom time,

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.250
we can roll back several days in the past.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.069
So we can pick a point yesterday,

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:59.085
we can pick our time, say 6:00 AM,

00:00:59.085 --> 00:01:07.325
and the only other thing that we need to specify is the Database Instance Identifier,

00:01:07.325 --> 00:01:09.920
which is just the database name.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.500
That's it. Everything else is the same as it will inherit all the characteristics of

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.545
the original database and then we say yes, launch database instance.

00:01:20.545 --> 00:01:22.470
That will go off and create,

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.420
and soon we'll have a database restored to yesterday at 6:00 AM.
