00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.535
High availability, also called HA design is critical and modern systems.

00:00:05.535 --> 00:00:08.850
HA systems has standby component's ready in

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.730
waiting to takeover supporting your application at a moments notice.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.755
The standby systems have up to the second copies of your data.

00:00:16.755 --> 00:00:20.130
Today's platforms are expected to be highly available.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.935
Building for fail over must be considered at

00:00:22.935 --> 00:00:26.415
every level of a system and must be part of the initial plan.

00:00:26.415 --> 00:00:30.030
Allowing for any individual component to fail and

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.885
having a standby system able to take over is no small task.

00:00:33.885 --> 00:00:37.860
But HA design allows for platform systems to

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.045
remain available regardless of any given server failing.

00:00:42.045 --> 00:00:45.720
Customers rely on software as a service systems.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.635
Thus HA design is table stakes,

00:00:48.635 --> 00:00:53.255
not only critical infrastructure applications are highly available these days.

00:00:53.255 --> 00:00:58.730
Netflix, for example, has highly redundant geographically distributed platform.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.170
In this course, you'll look and going beyond handling individual component failures,

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.810
and how you can handle entire data center outrages
