00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.430
How do you determine what amount of

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.945
free disk space is low enough on a database that you should be alerting on?

00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:13.095
The answer is you need to consider your historical usage of your database disk space,

00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:15.840
and you should give yourself at least a week.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.570
There's really no set amount of disk space to alert on.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.210
You need to consider your company's usage and the use case for that database.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.049
You really want to give yourself plenty of time to react to the situation.
