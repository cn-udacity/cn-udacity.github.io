00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.805
In this lesson, you've covered a lot of material.

00:00:02.805 --> 00:00:05.370
You've learned about the similarities and

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.760
differences between regions and availability zones.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.325
You've also seen how they form the underpinning of fault tolerance in AWS.

00:00:14.325 --> 00:00:17.760
Making proper use of these physical assets

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.110
allows you to create world-class worldwide platforms.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.555
VPCs and the networking you can create in AWS are closely related.

00:00:27.555 --> 00:00:34.875
You've looked at many common aspects of creating independent network segments within AWS,

00:00:34.875 --> 00:00:37.650
and how you can connect these segments together.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.700
Now that we've seen the base of high availability in AWS,

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.310
we move on to building with

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.675
resilience services before we get to considering our business goals.

00:00:47.675 --> 00:00:51.570
Then, observability and recoverability
