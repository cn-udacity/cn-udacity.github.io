00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
In this exercise, you'll be asked to create an SLA that

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.165
represents the up time and downtime of your platform.

00:00:08.165 --> 00:00:12.450
I've laid out a couple of steps that probably need to be included in your SLA.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.860
Section 1 would include your own applications,

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.030
that things that your company creates and are critical for your customers.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.470
What would be included there and what the SLA would be for those components.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.555
The second part of the SLA would cover things like third-parties,

00:00:30.555 --> 00:00:34.020
and what third party SLAs look like

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.385
or how that comes into play in your relationship with your customers.

00:00:38.385 --> 00:00:43.075
Finally, I would have a section that covered non-critical components.

00:00:43.075 --> 00:00:45.920
Things that are useful or nice to have,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.625
but not necessarily critical to the application and

00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:53.749
how those would be included or considered by your customers.

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:57.665
Together, all three of these make up a good picture of what

00:00:57.665 --> 00:01:02.820
is or is not covered by your SLA. Good luck.
