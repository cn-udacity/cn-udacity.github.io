00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.325
So far, we've looked at both the foundational redundancy pieces that AWS

00:00:05.325 --> 00:00:11.170
has and regions and Availability Zones as well as resilience within application services.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.470
Now we'll take a look at

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:18.150
understanding business objectives and how this relates to our work here.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.705
Later, we'll discuss reacting to failure.

00:00:21.705 --> 00:00:25.320
In this lesson, we'll start by discussing uptime.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.570
What it is and how to measure it.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.375
The opposite of uptime is downtime.

00:00:30.375 --> 00:00:34.035
Downtime isn't quite as straightforward as it appears.

00:00:34.035 --> 00:00:37.555
We'll learn different types of downtime and how to account for them.

00:00:37.555 --> 00:00:41.610
RTO is the Recovery Time Objective.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.205
This is your commitment,

00:00:43.205 --> 00:00:47.140
the maximum amount of time that your service would be down.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.455
Recovery Point Objective or

00:00:49.455 --> 00:00:54.485
RP0 is the maximum amount of time over which you would lose data.

00:00:54.485 --> 00:00:57.080
These are commitments that you would make

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.044
internally but also contractually to your customers.

00:01:01.044 --> 00:01:06.500
Disaster recovery is the extreme of availability and resiliency.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.414
It refers to bringing up your systems in another place,

00:01:10.414 --> 00:01:13.365
typically another AWS region.

00:01:13.365 --> 00:01:19.590
This would only be done in the case of a complete region outage or other disaster.
