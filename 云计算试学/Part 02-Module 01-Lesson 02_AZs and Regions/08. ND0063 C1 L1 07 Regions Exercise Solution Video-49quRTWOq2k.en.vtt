00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
When we create resources in one region,

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.515
they only appear in that one region.

00:00:04.515 --> 00:00:06.975
For example, as we can see,

00:00:06.975 --> 00:00:10.560
we've got an EC2 instance in the Ohio region.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.600
If we switch to another region,

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.950
we will see that that instance is no longer visible.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:27.885
This happens because we have to manage most resources within AWS on a per region basis.

00:00:27.885 --> 00:00:30.989
A few of the AWS global services,

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:36.285
such as IAM or Cloudfront are managed on a global scale.

00:00:36.285 --> 00:00:39.170
But all of these individual services,

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.270
most services within AWS,

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.030
you must pay attention to which region you're looking at.
