00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.885
Availability, reliability, resilience.

00:00:03.885 --> 00:00:07.560
Availability is how often a system operates as expected.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.030
This is typically measured as a percentage of the time a system is running.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.270
Reliability is how likely something is to be

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.990
operating as expected at any given point in time.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:26.440
Resiliency is how quickly and easily a system can be brought back online after an outage.
