00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.395
In this exercise, you are asked to setup a Multi-AZ ElastiCache cluster.

00:00:07.395 --> 00:00:12.735
We can see that the first thing we should do is set up our Subnet Group.

00:00:12.735 --> 00:00:15.615
When we look at our subnet group,

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:20.744
we can see that we have set up the group with multiple subnets,

00:00:20.744 --> 00:00:24.015
which lead us to multiple availability zones.

00:00:24.015 --> 00:00:27.119
Once we have our subnet group created,

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.160
then we can create our cluster.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.725
We can see that once our cluster is created,

00:00:34.725 --> 00:00:38.025
we have multiple nodes within the cluster.

00:00:38.025 --> 00:00:42.130
We can see their current role as either a primary or replica,

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.400
and we can also see that they are spread across multiple availability zones.
