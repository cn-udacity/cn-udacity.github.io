In this exercise, you'll be asked to create an RDS database with backups enabled and then

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.660
restore that database to a point in time to demonstrate a point in time recovery.
将该数据库复原到时间点以演示时间点恢复 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.110
Let's take a quick look at how to create this database.
让我们快速了解如何创建此数据库 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:22.140
Within AWS, we go into RDS and we create a database.
在 AWS 中 我们进入 RDS 并创建数据库 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.360
RDS will ask us,
RDS 会问我们

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.150
we want a standard or easy create.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.160
Doesn't make a whole lot difference, we'll say standard.
不会有很大的差别 我们会说标准 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.214
We are going to create a MySQL database,
我们要创建一个 MySQL 数据库

00:00:33.214 --> 00:00:37.385
scroll through a fair number of options.
滚动浏览一个公平的选项 

00:00:37.385 --> 00:00:39.785
You can say dev test,
你可以说 dev 测试

00:00:39.785 --> 00:00:43.310
just so that we have a simpler database.
所以我们有一个更简单的数据库

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:49.210
We can leave most of these settings as they are for this exercise.
我们可以把大部分这些设置留给他们来做 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.620
We'll choose a burstable class just to
我们会选择一个

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.275
save some money because the larger classes will cost more money.
省点钱 因为大班会花更多的钱 

00:00:57.275 --> 00:01:00.560
Then as we scroll all the way down,
当我们往下滚动时

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.685
we'll see that there is some additional configuration.

Now with the automatic backups enabled,
现在启用了自动备份 

00:01:15.425 --> 00:01:19.030
this is what enables us to actually do the point in time recovery.
这才使得我们能够真正做到时间点恢复 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.650
Which is why this is very important for this exercise,
所以这对这次演习很重要

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.105
to make sure that this checkbox is in fact checked.
以确保此复选框实际上已选中 

00:01:25.105 --> 00:01:28.800
