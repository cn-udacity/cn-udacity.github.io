00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
In this exercise, you are asked to create

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:09.195
a CloudFront distribution with a origin group as the source of your data.

00:00:09.195 --> 00:00:11.745
We've selected our CloudFront distribution,

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:13.260
but this has already been set up.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.235
We navigate to the Origins and Origin Group tab.

00:00:17.235 --> 00:00:20.880
We can see that we have two origins setup;

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.955
one representing each of our S3 buckets.

00:00:23.955 --> 00:00:27.555
Scrolling down, we can see that we have one origin group.

00:00:27.555 --> 00:00:33.995
This origin group is made up of both of these S3 origins that we've seen above,

00:00:33.995 --> 00:00:38.125
and that we have a primary and a DR-S3 bucket.

00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:40.910
We look at the Behaviors tab,

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.340
we can see that the only behavior we

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.680
have as a source of the origin group that we just looked at.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.340
This will then allow CloudFront to serve data from

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.415
our primary S3 bucket in our primary region as long as it's available.

00:00:57.415 --> 00:00:59.810
Should that region become unavailable,

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:06.450
S3 will automatically pull our data from the S3 bucket in our disaster recovery region.
