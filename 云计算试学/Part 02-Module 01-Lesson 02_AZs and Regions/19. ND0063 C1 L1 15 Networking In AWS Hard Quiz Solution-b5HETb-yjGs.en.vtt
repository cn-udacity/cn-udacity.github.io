00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.795
Which of the following CIDR networks is within 10.0.0.0/16?

00:00:06.795 --> 00:00:10.995
10.0.0.0/16 has a range

00:00:10.995 --> 00:00:19.590
of 10.0.0.0 through 10.0.255.255.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.405
So answer number one is a completely separate block.

00:00:24.405 --> 00:00:29.265
Answer number two is a separate block in another site or block.

00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:34.860
So it would be in the 10.1.0.0 /16 block.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.515
Answer three and four are both within

00:00:37.515 --> 00:00:46.830
10.0.0.0/16 as their respective addresses are 10.0.1.0

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.390
through 10.0.1.255 and

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:59.650
10.0.0.0 through 10.0.0.255.
