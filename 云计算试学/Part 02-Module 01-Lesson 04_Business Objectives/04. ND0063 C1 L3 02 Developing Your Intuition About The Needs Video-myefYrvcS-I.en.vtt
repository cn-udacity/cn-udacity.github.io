00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.075
When working across departments within your business,

00:00:03.075 --> 00:00:07.110
it's important to communicate regularly and clearly.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:12.585
Using the same language is a good way to make sure that all teams are on the same page.

It is imperative to be well-prepared when dealing with business objectives.

00:00:17.425 --> 00:00:22.920

00:00:39.815 --> 00:00:44.615
Practicing recovery operations is key to doing them well,

00:00:44.615 --> 00:00:47.825
which in turn is key to keeping relationships

00:00:47.825 --> 00:00:51.595
on solid footing with your peers in other parts of the business.

00:00:51.595 --> 00:00:54.620
We'll be taking a look at recovery metrics and

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.710
planning that tie in closely with business needs.
