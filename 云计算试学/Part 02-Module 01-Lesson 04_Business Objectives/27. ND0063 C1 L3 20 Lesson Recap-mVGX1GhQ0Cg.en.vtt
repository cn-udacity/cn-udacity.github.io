00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
In this lesson, you've worked on and created a variety of ways to meet

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.810
business objectives and have seen how they

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.585
relate to the work you do in creating available,

00:00:09.585 --> 00:00:11.805
reliable and resilient systems.

00:00:11.805 --> 00:00:14.550
You've measured uptime and downtime and

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.730
seen the intricacies of measuring and reporting on them.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.300
These concepts are not quite simple opposites but need to be

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.125
considered with scheduled maintenance integrated service as well.

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:29.414
We've also calculated RTO and RPO matrix

00:00:29.414 --> 00:00:34.185
to gain an understanding of what they are and how they apply to your business.

00:00:34.185 --> 00:00:37.920
Disaster recovery is the last line of defense when

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.755
a major disruption takes place in your main datacenter or region.

00:00:41.755 --> 00:00:46.640
You've practiced several options for disaster recovery configurations and

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.820
also identified which AWS services are best suited for your DR needs.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.945
So far we've looked at

00:00:53.945 --> 00:00:59.440
the foundational pieces that AWS has in regions and availability zones.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.565
The resilience options within applications services and now

00:01:04.565 --> 00:01:11.075
business objectives and how they tie into availability, reliability, and resiliency.

00:01:11.075 --> 00:01:18.360
Coming up, we'll discuss monitoring for and reacting to failures within our systems.
