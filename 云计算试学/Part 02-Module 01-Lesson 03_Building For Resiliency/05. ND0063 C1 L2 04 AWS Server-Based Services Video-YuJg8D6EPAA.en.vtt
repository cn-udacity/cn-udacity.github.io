00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.164
In this concept, you'll be introduced to services

00:00:03.164 --> 00:00:07.245
within AWS that are based on servers or instances.

00:00:07.245 --> 00:00:09.885
These services basically consist of

00:00:09.885 --> 00:00:14.400
individual servers that have software installed by AWS for you,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.635
and are managed by AWS.

00:00:16.635 --> 00:00:20.160
Having AWS run these servers as a service,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.300
removes a lot of the configuration and optimization work from your plate.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.480
Further, AWS can use their knowledge of

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.850
their internal infrastructure to create

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.640
the optimal environment for the service to run it.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.455
AWS has entire teams of experts operating these software applications,

00:00:37.455 --> 00:00:41.915
which allows you to spend your effort consuming these applications,

00:00:41.915 --> 00:00:44.465
not developing or maintaining them.

00:00:44.465 --> 00:00:47.735
How do we spot a server-based service?

00:00:47.735 --> 00:00:50.645
Does a service run in your VPC?

00:00:50.645 --> 00:00:54.635
Are you configuring a group of subnets for the service to use?

00:00:54.635 --> 00:00:58.490
These are good signs the service is server-based.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.805
Are you providing a security group for the service?

00:01:01.805 --> 00:01:04.385
Security groups belong to a VPC,

00:01:04.385 --> 00:01:07.060
and get placed on service instances.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.785
If you're choosing an instance type of instance family,

00:01:10.785 --> 00:01:14.590
very likely that this service is instance-based.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.405
Is the service an AWS managed service for a preexisting application?

00:01:20.405 --> 00:01:24.380
Think, MySQL, Redis, Elasticsearch,

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.250
these are all applications that you could run anywhere.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.235
AWS simply serves these applications for you.

00:01:31.235 --> 00:01:36.320
These services run generally the same versions of software you can get elsewhere.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.695
They're just being deployed to servers that AWS is managing for you.

00:01:41.695 --> 00:01:46.559
Some examples of server-based services in AWS,

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:50.640
ElastiCache, a managed caching service,

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.775
Elasticsearch, which is managed Elasticsearch, Document DB,

00:01:56.775 --> 00:02:01.785
AWS's managed MongoDB, and Elastic MapReduce,

00:02:01.785 --> 00:02:04.875
AWS's managed big data service.

00:02:04.875 --> 00:02:08.055
You might think these are just MySQL servers,

00:02:08.055 --> 00:02:10.665
why do I need to pay AWS to run them?

00:02:10.665 --> 00:02:12.555
Two important points here.

00:02:12.555 --> 00:02:16.025
One, AWS has teams of people who are

00:02:16.025 --> 00:02:19.925
experts in each one of these services. You likely do not.

00:02:19.925 --> 00:02:24.020
Two, RDS costs about the same as renting

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.310
the equivalent size EC2 instance and running the database yourself.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.800
But running a database yourself

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.790
entails all the overhead of system planning and maintenance.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.065
RDS takes care of all of that for you.

00:02:38.065 --> 00:02:41.585
These services provide a lot of value for slight,

00:02:41.585 --> 00:02:44.340
if any additional cost.
