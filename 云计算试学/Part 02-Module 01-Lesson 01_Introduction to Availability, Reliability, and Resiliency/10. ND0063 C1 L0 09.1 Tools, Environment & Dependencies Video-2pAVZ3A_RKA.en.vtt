00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.205
In this course, we'll mainly be using

00:00:02.205 --> 00:00:06.450
the AWS Console to interact the different services in AWS.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.840
We'll be exploring many different services,

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.020
and most of the usage that will cover and

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:18.325
consume throughout this course will be covered by the AWS Free Tier.

00:00:18.325 --> 00:00:22.865
To take as quick look or through some of the AWS Console,

00:00:22.865 --> 00:00:24.440
you should have a AWS account.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.525
If you don't already can sign up for one at aws.amazon.com,

00:00:29.525 --> 00:00:32.845
and we'll be looking at several different services.

00:00:32.845 --> 00:00:34.215
To highlight a few of them,

00:00:34.215 --> 00:00:35.850
this is the EC2 Console,

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.880
where you go to create EC2 instances.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.070
Looking at the VPC service,

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.685
this is where we'll spend some time looking through VPCs networking,

00:00:45.685 --> 00:00:49.655
and the different options for network access,

00:00:49.655 --> 00:00:55.590
both internal and external to your AWS VPCs and networking.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.320
We'll also spend some time looking at DynamoDB,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:09.090
Amazons non-relational database service, and also S3.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.000
Amazon servers for object storage,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.470
these are buckets where we can put objects files.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.500
We'll be looking at a lot of different options within S3,

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.379
the different storage tiers and different components,

00:01:22.379 --> 00:01:25.030
and features that make up S3.
