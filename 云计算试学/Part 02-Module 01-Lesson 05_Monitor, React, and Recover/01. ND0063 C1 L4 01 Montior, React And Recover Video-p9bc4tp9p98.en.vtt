00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
Building resilient platforms means making them as fault tolerant as possible,

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.255
but it also means making sure you're prepared to deal with failures when they do occur.

00:00:09.255 --> 00:00:13.230
In this lesson, you'll practice monitoring, reacting,

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.030
and recovering your service when those failures do happen, and they will.
