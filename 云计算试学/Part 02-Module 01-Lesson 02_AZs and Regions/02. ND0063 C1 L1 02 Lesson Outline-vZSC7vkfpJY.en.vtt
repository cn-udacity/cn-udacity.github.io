00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.605
Let's get started with the lesson,

00:00:01.605 --> 00:00:03.705
regions and availability zones.

00:00:03.705 --> 00:00:07.080
Later, we'll get into service level resiliency,

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.455
understanding business objectives, and reacting to failure.

00:00:10.455 --> 00:00:12.300
In this lesson, you will learn about

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.860
the physical and networking infrastructure that AWS provides.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.560
You'll built infrastructure that uses many of the capabilities of AWSs global footprint.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.145
You'll begin at the highest level with AWS regions.

00:00:26.145 --> 00:00:31.140
Then, we'll dive in and look at availability zones that live within regions.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.055
You will learn to distinguish between resources and specific regions

00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:39.355
versus the global AWS services which span all regions.

00:00:39.355 --> 00:00:45.145
Within regions are VPCs which are your own personal networks within AWS.

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:49.880
You will explore AWS networking by creating a new VPC and modifying

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.440
its network layout and access within the VPC private network.
