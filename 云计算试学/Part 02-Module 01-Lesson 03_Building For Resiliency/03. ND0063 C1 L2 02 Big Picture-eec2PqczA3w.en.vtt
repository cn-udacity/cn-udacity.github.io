00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.095
Resiliency doesn't stop with a region or VPC.

00:00:04.095 --> 00:00:07.530
Creating a platform that is holistically available

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.265
requires resiliency throughout each part of your service.

00:00:11.265 --> 00:00:13.380
To have a resilient platform,

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.810
all parts of it need to be fault tolerant.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.995
As you decide if a service needs to tolerate failures,

00:00:19.995 --> 00:00:23.610
you can let that decision drive choices about whether to

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.350
spend the time and dollars to make your applications resilient.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.300
Should you desire to,

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.645
AWS provides you the tools you need to make all components resilient.

00:00:35.645 --> 00:00:39.650
In this lesson, you'll practice driving redundancy

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.135
throughout your system by ensuring that not only the underlying network,

00:00:44.135 --> 00:00:49.680
but also the individual services on top of it are highly available.
