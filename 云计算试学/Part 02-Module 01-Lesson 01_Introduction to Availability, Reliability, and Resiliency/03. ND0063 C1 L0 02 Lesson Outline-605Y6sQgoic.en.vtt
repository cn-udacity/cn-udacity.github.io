00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
In this lesson, we'll start by reviewing

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.465
the course prerequisites and history of the high-level concepts.

00:00:06.465 --> 00:00:09.915
We'll discuss what makes these topics important.

00:00:09.915 --> 00:00:14.475
Today's consumers expect services to be up and running around the clock.

00:00:14.475 --> 00:00:17.160
So your application should be no different.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.580
Finally, I get a glimpse at the course project,

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.710
where you will build a highly resilient service that can survive many mishaps.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.130
You'll also see how to rollback the clock when things go wrong.
