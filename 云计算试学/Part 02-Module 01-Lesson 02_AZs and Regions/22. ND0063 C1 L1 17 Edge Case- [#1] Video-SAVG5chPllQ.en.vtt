00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
While there are some limitations to using a public Cloud and

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.320
that you can't do everything that you could do in your own data center,

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.120
you can do most things.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.455
However, AWS does not support multicast networking.

00:00:13.455 --> 00:00:19.320
You should take care to review the AWS policies on penetration testing and running

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.070
your own email server on AWS is another area that

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.195
use edge research and look at AWS policies before attempting.

00:00:27.195 --> 00:00:31.220
Further, when you're looking to solve problems in AWS,

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.925
and what you're trying to solve feels like a common problem,

00:00:34.925 --> 00:00:37.690
there's probably a solution for you.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.530
AWS has done a great job of listening to customers and identifying

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.540
common requests and addressing them for the majority of limitations in their Cloud.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.170
There are workarounds with only slight concessions that need to be made.
