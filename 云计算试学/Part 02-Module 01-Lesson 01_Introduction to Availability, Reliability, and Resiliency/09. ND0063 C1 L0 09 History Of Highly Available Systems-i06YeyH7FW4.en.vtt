00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
HA systems used to be extremely hard to build and maintain.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.659
These systems were very expensive,

00:00:06.659 --> 00:00:08.550
relied on custom hardware,

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.010
and required experts to operate them.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.975
They are used by governments and only a handful of industries such as telecommunications.

00:00:15.975 --> 00:00:18.600
More recently, HA has become more

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.155
achievable with commodity hardware and open-source software.

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:25.680
It still requires extensive time to set up and run.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.590
These systems do not need custom hardware,

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.880
they required even more expertise to maintain.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.260
The software was often open-source with no company to provide support.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.190
Today, in Cloud infrastructures like AWS,

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.095
highly available systems can be set up with a few clicks.

00:00:44.095 --> 00:00:47.775
Some knowledge is required to configure and test these systems,

00:00:47.775 --> 00:00:50.495
but the barrier to entry has been lowered dramatically,

00:00:50.495 --> 00:00:54.780
opening up these capabilities to far more organizations.
