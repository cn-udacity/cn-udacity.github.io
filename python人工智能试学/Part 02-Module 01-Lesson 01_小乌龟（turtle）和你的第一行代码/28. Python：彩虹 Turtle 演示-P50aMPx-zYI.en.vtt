00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.700
So, this exercise asked us to use this list of colors to draw a rainbow shape.
所以 这项运动要求我们用这个颜色列表画出彩虹的形状 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.030
In this video, I'm going to show how to make
在这个视频中 我将展示如何制作

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:11.669
a hexagon where each side is a different color.
一个六边形 每个边都是不同的颜色 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:15.689
Since there are six sides and a hexagon and six colors in this list,
既然这里有六面六色 

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:18.039
there will be one color for each side.
每边都有一个颜色 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.929
The first thing we need to do is add code to create a new turtle.
我们首先需要做的是添加代码来创建新的海龟 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:24.509
Then we can write the code to draw a hexagon.
然后我们可以写代码来绘制一个六边形 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.700
Now, we already have done something like that from
我们已经做过类似的事了

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.914
an earlier lesson but we just haven't made it rainbow-colored yet.
但我们还没有把它做成彩虹色

00:00:29.914 --> 00:00:33.530
When I'm experimenting with something new and I'm not quite sure how to do it,
当我尝试新事物时 我不太确定如何去做 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.710
I'll often start with whatever parts I know pretty well how to do and
我常常会从我最熟悉的地方开始

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.109
then work step-by-step from there toward what the new thing is.
然后从那里一步步走向新事物

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:43.519
So for now, I'm not going to worry about the rainbow part.
所以现在 我不会去担心彩虹部分 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.090
I'm just going to start by drawing a simple hexagon.
我只是从一个简单的六边形开始

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.845
To do that, I'm going to use a for loop.
要做到这一点 我要用一个 for 循环 

00:00:48.844 --> 00:00:51.469
Since the hexagon has six sides,
既然六边形有六个侧面

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:53.905
I'll have the loop run six times.
我将会有六次循环

00:00:53.905 --> 00:00:57.285
I can do that by using a list with six items like this.
我可以用一个包含 6 个项目的列表来做到这一点 

00:00:57.284 --> 00:00:59.384
Each time the loop runs,
每次循环运行时

00:00:59.384 --> 00:01:01.129
I'll have the turtle go forward by
我会让乌龟前进

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.280
100 pixels which will be one of the sides of the hexagon.
100 个像素 将是六边形的侧面之一 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.195
Then it needs to turn.
然后它需要转动 

00:01:06.194 --> 00:01:07.459
As we saw earlier,
正如我们刚才看到的

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:10.549
we can get the turning angle for any regular polygon by dividing
我们可以通过划分来获取任何正多边形的转角

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.969
360 degrees by however many sides the shape has.
但其形状有360 度 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:16.924
Three hundred and sixty divided by six is 60
360 除以 6 是 60

00:01:16.924 --> 00:01:20.409
so I'll have the turtle turn right by 60 degrees.
我会让海龟右转 60 度

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.319
So, at this point we should have functioning code that draws a hexagon.
所以 在这一点上 我们应该有一个可以使用六边形的功能代码 

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:26.929
Whenever I get to a point in my code where I
每当我在我的代码中找到一个点

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.620
think it should run and have some visible results,
认为它应该运行并产生一些可见的结果 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.905
I like to test it to make sure it's working how I expect.
我喜欢测试它以确保它的工作方式

00:01:32.905 --> 00:01:36.680
That way I could catch any little errors that I might have made while I was working,
这样我就能发现我在工作时可能犯的小错误

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.350
and yeah, it looks like it's drawing a hexagon.
好像是在画一个六边形

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:43.319
It's so little hard to see because it's using such a thin black line.
因为它用了这么薄的黑色线条 所以很难看 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:45.869
So one little thing I can change,
我可以改变一点

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.329
is make the line thicker using the width method.
使线条更厚 使用宽度方法 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.545
Now we need to think about changing the color.
现在我们需要考虑改变颜色 

00:01:53.545 --> 00:01:58.265
First, I'll start by just setting a single color like we've done before.
首先 我先设定一个像以前一样的颜色 

00:01:58.265 --> 00:02:01.775
I also don't particularly like the hexagon's off-center.
我也不特别喜欢六边形的离中心 

00:02:01.775 --> 00:02:03.725
It's kind of down off to the right.
从右到右

00:02:03.724 --> 00:02:07.809
So, I'm going to have the turtle back up a little before it starts drawing.
所以 我要让海龟在开始画画前稍微恢复一点 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.590
I now hide the turtle when it's done drawing just so that
我现在把乌龟藏起来

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.819
we don't have a little arrowhead shape sticking out of our shape.
我们没有一个小小的箭头形状

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.105
So now we need to think about how to get it to
所以现在我们要想想怎么弄

00:02:19.104 --> 00:02:22.164
change its color every time it runs through the loop,
每次都改变它的颜色

00:02:22.164 --> 00:02:25.304
and we know that we want to use this list of colors here.
我们知道我们想用这里的颜色列表

00:02:25.305 --> 00:02:28.420
More specifically, we need to use a different one of
更确切地说 我们需要使用不同的

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:32.189
the colors in this list every time the loop runs through.
每次循环运行时 此列表中的颜色 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:35.379
The trick here is to use the loop variable.
这里的诀窍是使用循环变量 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:38.824
Right now we have a loop variable named side,
现在我们有一个循环变量

00:02:38.824 --> 00:02:40.619
and each time the loop runs,
每次循环运行

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.099
this variable gets assigned a number from this list.
此变量将从该列表中指定一个编号 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:44.489
One through six.
一到六

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.750
But we're not doing anything with these numbers.
但我们没有对这些数字做任何事情 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.935
We're just using the fact that there are six of them.
我们只是用了其中的六个

00:02:48.935 --> 00:02:54.090
However, this rainbow list also has six items in it.
不过 这个彩虹名单里面还有 6 个项目 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.134
So, we could replace our list of numbers with that list of colors,
所以我们可以用那个颜色列表来替换我们的号码

00:02:59.134 --> 00:03:01.479
and our program shouldn't really do what it's doing.
我们的节目不该这么做

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:04.949
It should still draw a hexagon just like before.
它还应该像以前一样画一个六边形 

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:08.884
Now, since each of the items in this list is a color,
既然这个清单里的每一项都是一种颜色 

00:03:08.884 --> 00:03:13.294
I'm going to change the name of the variable from side to pretty color.
我要将变量的名称从侧面更改为漂亮的颜色 

00:03:13.294 --> 00:03:16.549
I called it pretty color rather than just color because I
我把它叫做颜色 而不是颜色 因为我

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.515
didn't want to confuse it with the color method.
不想把它和颜色的方法混为一谈

00:03:19.514 --> 00:03:21.909
Now each time the loop runs,
每次循环运行

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:25.819
the pretty color variable will be getting a different color from the list.
美丽的颜色变量将从列表中获取不同的颜色 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.709
First red then orange then yellow and so on.
先是红色 然后是橙色 然后是黄色等等 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.670
But we're still not doing anything with these colors.
但我们仍然没有用这些颜色做任何事情 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.039
So when we run the code,
所以当我们运行代码时

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:36.229
we just get a plane red hexagon and all we need to
我们只需要一个正六边形的飞机

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:42.840
do is to set the color based on that pretty color variable.
根据该颜色变量设置颜色 

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:46.319
So now each time the loop runs,
每次循环运行

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.500
we're passing a different color to
我们把不同的颜色传递给

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.354
the color method which is then used for one of the sides,
颜色的方法 然后用在一个侧面上 

00:03:52.354 --> 00:03:54.229
and there we go.
然后就开始了

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:55.759
A rainbow hexagon.
一个彩虹六边形
